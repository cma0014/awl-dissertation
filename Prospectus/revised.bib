abstract = {We study scheduling problems in battery-operated computing devices, aiming at schedules with low total energy consumption. While most of the previous work has focused on finding feasible schedules in deadline-based settings, in this article we are interested in schedules that guarantee good response times. More specifically, our goal is to schedule a sequence of jobs on a variable-speed processor so as to minimize the total cost consisting of the energy consumption and the total flow time of all jobs. We first show that when the amount of work, for any job, may take an arbitrary value, then no online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio. Therefore, most of the article is concerned with unit-size jobs. We devise a deterministic constant competitive online algorithm and show that the offline problem can be solved in polynomial time.},

abstract = {High-performance microprocessors, e.g., multithreaded and multicore processors, are being implemented in embedded real-time systems because of the increasing computational requirements. These complex microprocessors have two major drawbacks when they are used for real-time purposes. First, their complexity difficults the calculation of the WCET (worst case execution time). Second, power consumption requirements are much larger, which is a major concern in these systems. In this paper we propose a novel soft power-aware real-time scheduler for a state-of-the-art multicore multithreaded processor, which implements dynamic voltage scaling techniques. The proposed scheduler reduces the energy consumption while satisfying the constraints of soft real-time applications. Different scheduling alternatives have been evaluated, and experimental results show that using a fair scheduling policy, the proposed algorithm provides, on average, energy savings ranging from 34\% to 74\%.},

@article{Chan2009,
abstract = {This article extends the study of online algorithms for energy-efficient deadline scheduling to the overloaded setting. Specifically, we consider a processor that can vary its speed between 0 and a maximum speed T to minimize its energy usage (the rate is believed to be a cubic function of the speed). As the speed is upper bounded, the processor may be overloaded with jobs and no scheduling algorithms can guarantee to meet the deadlines of all jobs. An optimal schedule is expected to maximize the throughput, and furthermore, its energy usage should be the smallest among all schedules that achieve the maximum throughput. In designing a scheduling algorithm, one has to face the dilemma of selecting more jobs and being conservative in energy usage. If we ignore energy usage, the best possible online algorithm is 4-competitive on throughput [Koren and Shasha 1995]. On the other hand, existing work on energy-efficient scheduling focuses on a setting where the processor speed is unbounded and the concern is on minimizing the energy to complete all jobs; O(1)-competitive online algorithms with respect to energy usage have been known [Yao et al. 1995; Bansal et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2006]. This article presents the first online algorithm for the more realistic setting where processor speed is bounded and the system may be overloaded; the algorithm is O(1)-competitive on both throughput and energy usage. If the maximum speed of the online scheduler is relaxed slightly to (1+\&epsis;)T for some \&epsis; > 0, we can improve the competitive ratio on throughput to arbitrarily close to one, while maintaining O(1)-competitiveness on energy usage.},

abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, elevation in temperatures has brought
new challenges in reliability, timing, performance, cooling costs
and leakage power. Conventional thermal management techniques sacrifice
performance to control the thermal behavior by slowing down or turning
off the processors when a critical temperature threshold is exceeded.
Moreover, studies have shown that in addition to high temperatures,
temporal and spatial variations in temperature impact system reliability.
In this work, we explore the benefits of thermally aware task scheduling
for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We design and evaluate
OS-level dynamic scheduling policies with negligible performance
overhead. We show that, using simple to implement policies that make
decisions based on temperature measurements, better temporal and
spatial thermal profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art
schedulers. We also enhance reactive strategies such as dynamic thread
migration with our scheduling policies. This way, hot spots and temperature
variations are decreased, and the performance cost is significantly
reduced},

abstract = {Thermal hot spots and high temperature gradients degrade reliability and performance, and increase cooling costs and leakage power. In this paper, we explore the benefits of temperature-aware task scheduling for multiprocessor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We evaluate our techniques using workload characteristics collected from a real system by Sun's Continuous System Telemetry. We first solve the task scheduling problem statically using integer linear programming (ILP). The ILP solution is guaranteed to be optimal for the given assumptions for tasks. We formulate ILPs for minimizing energy, balancing energy, and reducing hot spots, and provide an extensive comparison of their thermal behavior against our technique. Our static solution can reduce the frequency of hot spots by 35\%, spatial gradients by 85\%, and thermal cycles by 61\% in comparison to the ILP for minimizing energy. We then design dynamic scheduling policies at the OS-level with negligible performance overhead. Our adaptive dynamic policy reduces the frequency of high-magnitude thermal cycles and spatial gradients by around 50\% and 90\%, respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art schedulers. Reactive thermal management strategies, such as thread migration, can be combined with our scheduling policy to further reduce hot spots, temperature variations, and the associated performance cost.},

abstract = {Computing has recently reached an inflection point with the introduction of multi-core processors. On-chip thread-level parallelism is doubling approximately every other year. Concurrency lends itself naturally to allowing a program to trade performance for power savings by regulating the number of active cores, however in several domains users are unwilling to sacrifice performance to save power. We present a prediction model for identifying energy-efficient operating points of concurrency in well-tuned multithreaded scientific applications, and a runtime system which uses live program analysis to optimize applications dynamically. We describe a dynamic, phase-aware performance prediction model that combines multivariate regression techniques with runtime analysis of data collected from hardware event counters to locate optimal operating points of concurrency. Using our model, we develop a prediction-driven, phase-aware runtime optimization scheme that throttles concurrency so that power consumption can be reduced and performance can be set at the knee of the scalability curve of each program phase. The use of prediction reduces the overhead of searching the optimization space while achieving near-optimal performance and power savings. A thorough evaluation of our approach shows a reduction in power consumption of 10.8\% simultaneous with an improvement in performance of 17.9\%, resulting in energy savings of 26.7\%.},

abstract = {Large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) systems continue to be designed and constructed to extend performance beyond Petascales using monolithic, cluster, and distributed architectures and emerging multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU) technologies. As these machines grow so too does the size and variety of applications that run on them. Yet power management and interconnection performance are of great and mounting concern, and to date, the understanding of HPC subsystem interactions and their relationships to power efficiency remains less than desirable. Furthermore, Executive Order 13423 was issued in January of 2007 in an effort to ensure that Federal agencies operate in an environmentally, economically, and fiscally sound manner. It mandates a 30\% reduction in energy intensity (MBTUs per square foot) of government facilities in the FY06-15 timeframe using FY03 as a baseline. Two major drawbacks hinder their ability to sustain consistent run time and energy efficient performance: (1) major subsystems interact with each other, often at the expense of unpredictable application run time and energy consumption, and (2) increased power density of these machines complicates the space, power, and cooling problem, resulting in partial or full system down time, further exacerbating run time unpredictability. We believe that one fundamental reason for the above limitations is the operational isolation of loosely coupled subsystems. While the development of subsystems in isolation has been the dominant model for decades, it is inherently unsuitable for ensuring consistent and sustainable systemic performance. We propose that the collection of HPC sub-systems, including the set of running applications must be collaborative in nature, and as such the HPC systems full potential is limited by subsystem isolation and autonomous actions to improve their individual subsystem performance. This paper describes an approach for using “Application-Level Behavior- - al Attribute Driven Techniques” to characterize HPC subsystem interactions into meaningful metrics and correlates that can be used as inputs to algorithms to control large-scale behaviors (job schedulers, routers, and HVAC systems) as well as smaller-scale behaviors such as CPU frequency and voltage scaling to achieve improved run time and energy efficiency to help satisfy Executive Order 13423.},

It shows that we can map many of the voltage emergencies in the execution of the SPEC benchmarks on an aggressive superscalar design to a few static loops, categorize the microarchitectural cause of the emergencies in each important loop through simple observations and a simple priority function, and finally apply straight forward software optimization strategies to mitigate up to 70\% of the future voltage swings.},

abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases. Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9\% for SPEC and 7.1\% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9\% average errors for SPEC and 11.7\% for other benchmarks respectively.},

abstract = {Energy and thermal considerations are increasingly driving system designers to adopt multi-core processors. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling periodic real-time tasks on multi-core processors using fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. Specifically, we focus on the partitioned (static binding) approach, which statically allocates tasks to processing cores. The well-established 50\% bound for partitioned multiprocessor scheduling [10] can be overcome by task-splitting (TS) [19], which allows a task to be split across more than one core. We prove that a utilization bound of 60\% per core can be achieved by the partitioned deadline-monotonic scheduling (PDMS) class of algorithms on implicit-deadline task sets, when the highest-priority task on each processing core is allowed to be split (HPTS). Given the widespread usage of fixed-priority scheduling in commercial real-time and non real-time operating systems (e.g. VxWorks, Linux), establishing such utilization bounds is both relevant and useful. We also show that a specific instance of PDMS\_ HPTS, where tasks are allocated in the decreasing order of size, called PDMS\_HPTS\_ DS, has a utilization bound of 65\% on implicit deadline task-sets. The PDMS\_ HPTS\_ DS algorithm also achieves a utilization bound of 69\% on lightweight implicit-deadline task-sets where no single task utilization exceeds 41.4\%. The average-case behavior of PDMS\_ HPTS\_ DS is studied using randomly generated task-sets, and it is seen to have an average schedulable utilization of 88\%. We also characterize the overhead of task-splitting using measurements on an Intel Core 2 Duo processor.},

We develop a linear regression model that relates processor power, bus activity, and system ambient temperatures into real-time predictions of the power consumption of long jobs and as result controlling their thermal impact. Using the HyperTransport bus model as a case study and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we develop a statistical model for estimating run-time power consumption.

scenarios where processors are fully loaded, i.e. there are no free

use system-level compiler support and dynamic runtime instrumentation

These problems emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance

abstract = {Fairness is an essential requirement of any operating system scheduler. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms are either inaccurate or inefficient and non-scalable for multiprocessors. This problem is becoming increasingly severe as the hardware industry continues to produce larger scale multi-core processors. This paper presents Distributed Weighted Round-Robin (DWRR), a new scheduling algorithm that solves this problem. With distributed thread queues and small additional overhead to the underlying scheduler, DWRR achieves high efficiency and scalability. Besides conventional priorities, DWRR enables users to specify weights to threads and achieve accurate proportional CPU sharing with constant error bounds. DWRR operates in concert with existing scheduler policies targeting other system attributes, such as latency and throughput. As a result, it provides a practical solution for various production OSes. To demonstrate the versatility of DWRR,we have implemented it in Linux kernels 2.6.22.15 and 2.6.24, which represent two vastly different scheduler designs. Our evaluation shows that DWRR achieves accurate proportional fairness and high performance for a diverse set of workloads.},

abstract = {With technology advances, the number of cores integrated on a chip and their speed of operation is increasing. This, in turn is leading to a significant increase in chip temperature. Temperature gradients and hot-spots not only affect the performance of the system, but also lead to unreliable circuit operation and affect the life-time of the chip. Meeting the temperature constraints and reducing the hot-spots are critical for achieving reliable and efficient operation of complex multi-core systems. In this work, we present Pro-Temp, a convex optimization based method that pro-actively controls the temperature of the cores, while minimizing the power consumption and satisfying application performance constraints. The method guarantees that the temperature of the cores are below a user- defined threshold at all instances of operation, while also reducing the hot-spots. We perform experiments on several realistic multi-core benchmarks, which show that the proposed method guarantees that the cores never exceed the maximum temperature limit, while matching the application performance requirements. We compare this to traditional methods, where we find several temperature violations during the operation of the system.},

abstract = {Inductive noise forces microprocessor designers to sacrifice performance in order to ensure correct and reliable operation of their designs. The possibility of wide fluctuations in supply voltage means that timing margins throughout the processor must be set pessimistically to protect against worst-case droops and surges. While sensor-based reactive schemes have been proposed to deal with voltage noise, inherent sensor delays limit their effectiveness. Instead, this paper describes a voltage emergency predictor that learns the signatures of voltage emergencies (the combinations of control flow and microarchitectural events leading up to them) and uses these signatures to prevent recurrence of the corresponding emergencies. In simulations of a representative superscalar microprocessor in which fluctuations beyond 4\% of nominal voltage are treated as emergencies (an aggressive configuration), these signatures can pinpoint the likelihood of an emergency some 16 cycles ahead of time with 90\% accuracy. This lead time allows machines to operate with much tighter voltage margins (4\% instead of 13\%) and up to 13.5\% higher performance, which closely approaches the 14.2\% performance improvement possible with an ideal oracle-based predictor.},

The emergence of third-party application stores and marketplaces makes this concern even more pressing. A third-party application must not deny service through excessive, unforeseen energy expenditure, whether accidental or malicious. Previous research has shown promise in tracking energy usage and rationing it to meet device lifetime goals, but such mechanisms and policies are still nascent, especially regarding user interaction. We argue for a new operating system, called Cinder, which builds on top of the HiStar OS. Cinder's energy awareness is based on hierarchical capacitors and task profiles. We introduce and explore these abstractions, paying particular attention to the ways in which policies could be generated and enforced in a dynamic system.},

abstract = {Current approaches to power management are based on operating systems with full knowledge of and full control over the underlying hardware; the distributed nature of multi-layered virtual machine environments renders such approaches insufficient. In this paper, we present a novel framework for energy management in modular, multi-layered operating system structures. The framework provides a unified model to partition and distribute energy, and mechanisms for energy-aware resource accounting and allocation. As a key property, the framework explicitly takes the recursive energy consumption into account, which is spent, e.g., in the virtualization layer or subsequent driver components. Our prototypical implementation targets hypervisor-based virtual machine systems and comprises two components: a host-level subsystem, which controls machine-wide energy constraints and enforces them among all guest OSes and service components, and, complementary, an energy-aware guest operating system, capable of fine-grained application-specific energy management. Guest level energy management thereby relies on effective virtualization of physical energy effects provided by the virtual machine monitor. Experiments with CPU and disk devices and an external data acquisition system demonstrate that our framework accurately controls and stipulates the power consumption of individual hardware devices, both for energy-aware and energyunaware guest operating systems.},

This can lead to fairness issue in a multi-threaded environment as the Linux scheduler tends to favor programs with higher number of threads. We illustrate the issue of fairness through experimental evaluation thus exposing the weakness of the current allocation scheme where software developers could take advantage by spawning many additional threads in order to obtain more CPU resources. A novel algorithm is proposed as a solution towards achieving better fairness in the Linux scheduler. The algorithm is based on weight readjustment of the threads created in the same process to significantly reduce the unfair allocation of CPU resources in multi-threaded environments. The algorithm was implemented and evaluated. It demonstrated promising results towards solving the raised fairness issue.

abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by their increasing
power consumption and the heat generation speed on-die. High temperature
impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. While
hardware level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques, such
as voltage and frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip
temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold, they inevitably
come at the cost of performance degradation. We propose an OS level
technique that performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the
number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces the amount of
hardware DTMs and achieves higher performance while keeping the temperature
low. Our methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal behavior
among different workloads, and schedule them to keep the chip temperature
below a given budget. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the
observation that there is a difference in the resulting temperature
when a hot and a cool job are executed in a different order. To evaluate
our scheduling algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime temperature
monitor to enable informed scheduling decisions. We have implemented
our scheduling algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring framework
in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler can remove 10.5-73.6\%
of the hardware DTMs in various combinations of workloads in a medium
thermal environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was improved
by up to 7.6\% (4.1\% on average) even under a severe thermal environment.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly popular, from laptops, PDAs, and cell phones to emerging platforms such as wireless sensor networks. Available battery energy has become a critical mobile-system resource. A mobile device's usefulness is often limited not by its hardware's raw speed but by its battery's energy. Energy consumption is a major systems-design challenge. We designed our ECOSystem (Energy-Centric Operating System) prototype to manage energy consumption at the OS level, complementing existing power-management techniques, such as DVS and application adaptation. It's based on the ideas that energy management should be a system-wide effort, that we should explicitly recognize energy as a resource, and that we should unify energy management across the system. Even managing one hardware device might require coordination with other system components. Without unified management, application-level energy-saving efforts might not result in reduced energy consumption. ECOSystem incorporates the "currentcy model", which lets the operating system manage energy as a first-class resource. It can also express complex energy-related goals and behaviors, leading to more effective, unified management policies.},

abstract = {Energy consumption has recently been widely recognized as a major challenge of computer systems design. This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.},

abstract = {A rising horizon in chip fabrication is the 3D integration technology.
It stacks two or more dies vertically with a dense, high-speed interface
to increase the device density and reduce the delay of interconnects
significantly across the dies. However, a major challenge in 3D technology
is the increased power density, which gives rise to the concern of
heat dissipation within the processor. High temperatures trigger
voltage and frequency throttlings in hardware, which degrade the
chip performance. Moreover, high temperatures impair the processor's
reliability and reduce its lifetime. To alleviate this problem, we
propose in this paper an OS-level scheduling algorithm that performs
thermal-aware task scheduling on a 3D chip. Our algorithm leverages
the inherent thermal variations within and across different tasks,
and schedules them to keep the chip temperature low. We observed
that vertically adjacent dies have strong thermal correlations and
the scheduler should consider them jointly. Compared with other intuitive
algorithms such as a Random and a Round-Robin algorithm, our proposed
algorithm brings lower peak temperature and average temperature on-chip.
Moreover, it can remove, on average, 46 percent of thermal emergency
time and result in 5.11 percent (4.78 percent) performance improvement
over the base case on thermally homogeneous (heterogeneous) floorplans.},
