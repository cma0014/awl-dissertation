	Abstract = {Modern shared memory multiprocessor systems commonly
                  have non-uniform memory access (NUMA) with asymmetric
                  memory bandwidth and latency
                  characteristics. Operating systems now provide
                  application programmer interfaces allowing the user to
                  perform specific thread and memory placement. To date,
                  however, there have been relatively few detailed
                  assessments of the importance of memory/thread
                  placement for complex applications.  This paper
                  outlines a framework for performing memory and thread
                  placement experiments on Solaris and Linux. Thread
                  binding and location specific memory allocation and
                  its verification is discussed and contrasted.  Using
                  the framework, the performance characteristics of
                  serial versions of lmbench, Stream and various BLAS
                  libraries (ATLAS, GOTO, ACML on Opteron/Linux and
                  Sunperf on Opteron, UltraSPARC/Solaris) are measured
                  on two different hardware platforms
                  (UltraSPARC/FirePlane and Opteron/HyperTransport). A
                  simple model describing performance as a function of
                  memory distribution is proposed and assessed for both
                  the Opteron and UltraSPARC.  },

@book{Bautista2008,
	Abstract = {High-performance microprocessors, e.g., multithreaded
                  and multicore processors, are being implemented in
                  embedded real-time systems because of the increasing
                  computational requirements. These complex
                  microprocessors have two major drawbacks when they are
                  used for real-time purposes. First, their complexity
                  difficults the calculation of the WCET (worst case
                  execution time). Second, power consumption
                  requirements are much larger, which is a major concern
                  in these systems. In this paper we propose a novel
                  soft power-aware real-time scheduler for a
                  state-of-the-art multicore multithreaded processor,
                  which implements dynamic voltage scaling
                  techniques. The proposed scheduler reduces the energy
                  consumption while satisfying the constraints of soft
                  real-time applications. Different scheduling
                  alternatives have been evaluated, and experimental
                  results show that using a fair scheduling policy, the
                  proposed algorithm provides, on average, energy
                  savings ranging from 34\% to 74\%.},

@article{Bell2005,
	Abstract = { Power dissipation has become an important
                  consideration for processor designs. Assessing power
                  using simulators is problematic given the long
                  runtimes of real applications. Researchers have
                  responded with techniques to reduce the total number
                  of simulated instructions while still maintaining
                  representative simulation behavior. Synthetic
                  testcases have been shown to reduce the number of
                  necessary instructions significantly while still
                  achieving accurate performance results for many
                  workload characteristics. In this paper, we show that
                  the synthetic testcases can rapidly and accurately
                  assess the dynamic power dissipation of real
                  programs. Synthetic versions of the SPEC2000 and
                  STREAM benchmarks can predict the total power per
                  cycle to within 6.8% error on average, with a maximum
                  of 15% error, and total power per instruction to
                  within 4.4% error. In addition, for many design
                  changes for which IPC and power change significantly,
                  the synthetic testcases show small errors, many less
                  than 5%. We also show that simulated power dissipation
                  for both applications and synthetics correlates well
                  with the IPCs of the real programs, often giving a
                  correlation coefficient greater than 0.9.},

	Abstract = {This article extends the study of online algorithms
                  for energy-efficient deadline scheduling to the
                  overloaded setting. Specifically, we consider a
                  processor that can vary its speed between 0 and a
                  maximum speed T to minimize its energy usage (the rate
                  is believed to be a cubic function of the speed). As
                  the speed is upper bounded, the processor may be
                  overloaded with jobs and no scheduling algorithms can
                  guarantee to meet the deadlines of all jobs. An
                  optimal schedule is expected to maximize the
                  throughput, and furthermore, its energy usage should
                  be the smallest among all schedules that achieve the
                  maximum throughput. In designing a scheduling
                  algorithm, one has to face the dilemma of selecting
                  more jobs and being conservative in energy usage. If
                  we ignore energy usage, the best possible online
                  algorithm is 4-competitive on throughput [Koren and
                  Shasha 1995]. On the other hand, existing work on
                  energy-efficient scheduling focuses on a setting where
                  the processor speed is unbounded and the concern is on
                  minimizing the energy to complete all jobs;
                  O(1)-competitive online algorithms with respect to
                  energy usage have been known [Yao et al. 1995; Bansal
                  et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2006]. This article presents
                  the first online algorithm for the more realistic
                  setting where processor speed is bounded and the
                  system may be overloaded; the algorithm is
                  O(1)-competitive on both throughput and energy
                  usage. If the maximum speed of the online scheduler is
                  relaxed slightly to (1+\&epsis;)T for some \&epsis; >
                  0, we can improve the competitive ratio on throughput
                  to arbitrarily close to one, while maintaining
                  O(1)-competitiveness on energy usage.},

	Abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, elevation in temperatures
                  has brought new challenges in reliability, timing,
                  performance, cooling costs and leakage
                  power. Conventional thermal management techniques
                  sacrifice performance to control the thermal behavior
                  by slowing down or turning off the processors when a
                  critical temperature threshold is exceeded.  Moreover,
                  studies have shown that in addition to high
                  temperatures, temporal and spatial variations in
                  temperature impact system reliability.  In this work,
                  we explore the benefits of thermally aware task
                  scheduling for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip

                  scheduling policies with negligible performance

                  policies that make decisions based on temperature
                  measurements, better temporal and spatial thermal
                  profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art

                  as dynamic thread migration with our scheduling

                  degrade reliability and performance, and increase
                  cooling costs and leakage power. In this paper, we
                  explore the benefits of temperature-aware task
                  scheduling for multiprocessor system-on-a-chip
                  (MPSoC). We evaluate our techniques using workload
                  characteristics collected from a real system by Sun's
                  Continuous System Telemetry. We first solve the task
                  scheduling problem statically using integer linear
                  programming (ILP). The ILP solution is guaranteed to
                  be optimal for the given assumptions for tasks. We
                  formulate ILPs for minimizing energy, balancing
                  energy, and reducing hot spots, and provide an
                  extensive comparison of their thermal behavior against
                  our technique. Our static solution can reduce the
                  frequency of hot spots by 35\%, spatial gradients by
                  85\%, and thermal cycles by 61\% in comparison to the
                  ILP for minimizing energy. We then design dynamic
                  scheduling policies at the OS-level with negligible
                  performance overhead. Our adaptive dynamic policy
                  reduces the frequency of high-magnitude thermal cycles
                  and spatial gradients by around 50\% and 90\%,
                  respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art
                  schedulers. Reactive thermal management strategies,
                  such as thread migration, can be combined with our
                  scheduling policy to further reduce hot spots,
                  temperature variations, and the associated performance
                  cost.},

                  level solution for dealing with the thermal issues on
                  CMP. We propose a TAS algorithm based on look up
                  tables to allow the rapid calculation of the
                  post-thermal map from the current thermal profile. We
                  propose two different metrics for determining where to
                  place the task: one based on the maximum core
                  temperature in the post-thermal map; and another based
                  on the sum of the product of the post-thermal map
                  temperature and the remaining task runtime for each
                  core. Experimental results show that our algorithms
                  are better, particularly for high power applications,
                  at minimizing the peak/average temperature, and are
                  able to achieve an average rejection ratio of about

	Abstract = {Computing has recently reached an inflection point
                  with the introduction of multi-core
                  processors. On-chip thread-level parallelism is
                  doubling approximately every other year. Concurrency
                  lends itself naturally to allowing a program to trade
                  performance for power savings by regulating the number
                  of active cores, however in several domains users are
                  unwilling to sacrifice performance to save power. We
                  present a prediction model for identifying
                  energy-efficient operating points of concurrency in
                  well-tuned multithreaded scientific applications, and
                  a runtime system which uses live program analysis to
                  optimize applications dynamically. We describe a
                  dynamic, phase-aware performance prediction model that
                  combines multivariate regression techniques with
                  runtime analysis of data collected from hardware event
                  counters to locate optimal operating points of
                  concurrency. Using our model, we develop a
                  prediction-driven, phase-aware runtime optimization
                  scheme that throttles concurrency so that power
                  consumption can be reduced and performance can be set
                  at the knee of the scalability curve of each program
                  phase. The use of prediction reduces the overhead of
                  searching the optimization space while achieving
                  near-optimal performance and power savings. A thorough
                  evaluation of our approach shows a reduction in power
                  consumption of 10.8\% simultaneous with an improvement
                  in performance of 17.9\%, resulting in energy savings
                  of 26.7\%.},

	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring
                  multicore/multithreaded processors and high component
                  density, power-aware high-performance multithreading
                  libraries become a critical element of the system
                  software stack. Online power and performance
                  adaptation of multithreaded code from within
                  user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and
                  unexplored area of research. We present a user-level
                  library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation
                  of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance
                  execution. Our framework operates by regulating
                  concurrency and changing the processors/threads
                  configuration as the program executes. It is
                  innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance
                  prediction derived from hardware event-driven
                  profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve
                  nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of
                  predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of
                  granularity control and program adaptation. Our
                  framework achieves performance and ED2
                  (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable
                  to or better than those of oracle-derived offline
                  predictors; ii) significantly better than those of
                  online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear
                  search. The complete prediction and adaptation
                  framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system
                  with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds
                  adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},

@book{Evans2010,
	Abstract = {Large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) systems
                  continue to be designed and constructed to extend
                  performance beyond Petascales using monolithic,
                  cluster, and distributed architectures and emerging
                  multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU)
                  technologies. As these machines grow so too does the
                  size and variety of applications that run on them. Yet
                  power management and interconnection performance are
                  of great and mounting concern, and to date, the
                  understanding of HPC subsystem interactions and their
                  relationships to power efficiency remains less than
                  desirable. Furthermore, Executive Order 13423 was
                  issued in January of 2007 in an effort to ensure that
                  Federal agencies operate in an environmentally,
                  economically, and fiscally sound manner. It mandates a
                  30\% reduction in energy intensity (MBTUs per square
                  foot) of government facilities in the FY06-15
                  timeframe using FY03 as a baseline. Two major
                  drawbacks hinder their ability to sustain consistent
                  run time and energy efficient performance: (1) major
                  subsystems interact with each other, often at the
                  expense of unpredictable application run time and
                  energy consumption, and (2) increased power density of
                  these machines complicates the space, power, and
                  cooling problem, resulting in partial or full system
                  down time, further exacerbating run time
                  unpredictability. We believe that one fundamental
                  reason for the above limitations is the operational
                  isolation of loosely coupled subsystems. While the
                  development of subsystems in isolation has been the
                  dominant model for decades, it is inherently
                  unsuitable for ensuring consistent and sustainable
                  systemic performance. We propose that the collection
                  of HPC sub-systems, including the set of running
                  applications must be collaborative in nature, and as
                  such the HPC systems full potential is limited by
                  subsystem isolation and autonomous actions to improve
                  their individual subsystem performance. This paper
                  describes an approach for using ``Application-Level
                  Behavior- - al Attribute Driven Techniques'' to
                  characterize HPC subsystem interactions into
                  meaningful metrics and correlates that can be used as
                  inputs to algorithms to control large-scale behaviors
                  (job schedulers, routers, and HVAC systems) as well as
                  smaller-scale behaviors such as CPU frequency and
                  voltage scaling to achieve improved run time and
                  energy efficiency to help satisfy Executive Order

	Abstract = {The performance-at-any-cost design mentality ignores
                  supercomputers' excessive power consumption and need
                  for heat dissipation and will ultimately limit their
                  performance. Without fundamental change in the design
                  of supercomputing systems, the performance advances
                  common over the past two decades won't continue. The
                  HPC community needs a Green500 List to rank
                  supercomputers on speed and power requirements and to
                  supplement the TOP500 List. Vendors and system
                  architects worldwide take substantial pride and invest
                  tremendous effort toward making the biannual TOP500
                  List. We anticipate that the Green500 List effort will
                  do the same and encourage the HPC community and
                  operators of Internet data centers to design more

	Abstract = {Increases in peak current draw and reductions in the
                  operating voltages of processors continue to amplify
                  the importance of dealing with voltage fluctuations in
                  processors. One approach suggested has been to not
                  only react to these fluctuations but also attempt to
                  eliminate future occurrences of these fluctuations by
                  dynamically modifying the executing program. This
                  paper investigates the potential of a very simple
                  dynamic scheme to appreciably reduce the number of
                  run-time voltage emergencies. It shows that we can map
                  many of the voltage emergencies in the execution of
                  the SPEC benchmarks on an aggressive superscalar
                  design to a few static loops, categorize the
                  microarchitectural cause of the emergencies in each
                  important loop through simple observations and a
                  simple priority function, and finally apply straight
                  forward software optimization strategies to mitigate
                  up to 70\% of the future voltage swings.},

                  power-aware operations of Kyoto University's
                  supercomputer system. The supercomputer system of 10
                  TFlops had required about 540 kW on average in its
                  first fiscal year 2004. After that and one-year
                  try-and-error of power efficient operation, we
                  implemented a simple but effective scheduler of jobs
                  and machine powering to improve the per- load power
                  efficiency by up to 39 \% and to save 200 kW and
                  \{\$\}200,000 electric charge in the fiscal year

	Abstract = { Execution-driven simulators are often used for
                  power/energy and performance evaluation. Simulators
                  can provide semantic details but they provide
                  insufficient speed and accuracy for compiler and OS
                  research. Physical measurement is fast and objective
                  but lacks a semantic connection between the
                  measurement result and the evaluated program. The
                  objective of our research is to bring together the
                  advantages of simulation and physical measurement to
                  build an infrastructure for power and energy
                  optimization. Power and energy behavior is obtained
                  through physical measurement. Simulation is used for
                  observing the connection between power and energy
                  behavior and the evaluated program. Our preliminary
                  results demonstrate the ability of this infrastructure
                  to capture detailed power behavior of any region of a
                  program. To simplify the power/energy evaluation of
                  programs with long execution times and overcome the
                  limitation of physical devices, we propose using the
                  SimPoints methodology developed by researchers at UC
                  San Diego to find representative slices of a
                  program. Through simulation, we validate the
                  feasibility of the SimPoint idea in simplifying
                  power/energy evaluation. We expect that this
                  infrastructure will help researchers in OS/compiler
                  power/energy optimization to evaluate their
                  optimizations more efficiently and observe more

                  high performance computing and business computing, the
                  IBM System x3755 is built for speed. The x3755
                  eliminates system architecture bottlenecks through the
                  use of separate, high-speed links between the
                  processors, main memory, and I/O. The AMD Direct
                  Connect Architecture and HyperTransport technology
                  combined with IBM Xcelerated Memory Technology drive
                  the x3755 to deliver the performance, availability,
                  and manageability needed for the next generation of
                  high performance computing servers that require low

@article{Isci2003a,
	Abstract = { Characterizing program behavior is important for both
                  hardware and software research. Most modern
                  applications exhibit distinctly different behavior
                  throughout their runtimes, which constitute several
                  phases of execution that share a greater amount of
                  resemblance within themselves compared to other
                  regions of execution. These execution phases can occur
                  at very large scales, necessitating prohibitively long
                  simulation times for characterization. Due to the
                  implementation of extensive clock gating and
                  additional power and thermal management techniques in
                  modern processors, these program phases are also
                  reflected in program power behavior, which can be used
                  as an alternative means of program behavior
                  characterization for power-oriented research. In this
                  paper, we present our methodology for identifying
                  phases in program power behavior and determining
                  execution points that correspond to these phases, as
                  well as defining a small set of power signatures
                  representative of overall program power behavior. We
                  define a power similarity metric as an intersection of
                  both magnitude based and ratio-wise similarities in
                  the power dissipation of processor components. We then
                  develop a thresholding algorithm in order to partition
                  the power behavior into similarity groups. We
                  illustrate our methodology with the gzip benchmark for
                  its whole runtime and characterize gzip power behavior
                  with both the selected execution points and defined
                  signature vectors.},

@article{Isci2003b,
	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly
                  vexing problem across many classes of computer
                  systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running
                  systems has become crucial for hardware and software
                  system research and design. Live power measurements
                  are imperative for studies requiring execution times
                  too long for simulation, such as thermal
                  analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more
                  complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power
                  management techniques, per-component estimates of
                  power dissipation have become both more challenging as
                  well as more important. In this paper we describe our
                  technique for a coordinated measurement approach that
                  combines real total power measurement with
                  performance-counter-based, per-unit power
                  estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power
                  measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also
                  provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU
                  subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload
                  execution. As an example application, we use the
                  generated component power breakdowns to identify
                  program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper
                  demonstrates a processor power measurement and
                  estimation methodology and also gives experiences and
                  empirical application results that can provide a basis
                  for future power-aware research.},

@article{Isci2006,
	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic,
                  phase-based system management techniques, in which
                  system hardware and software parameters may be altered
                  or tuned at runtime for different program
                  phases. Prior research has considered a range of
                  possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused
                  almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the
                  notion of power-oriented phases has not been
                  explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies
                  have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need
                  for real-system experiments that provide direct
                  comparison of different practical techniques (such as
                  control flow sampling, event counters, and power
                  measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this
                  paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system
                  measurement framework for collecting and analyzing
                  power phases in running applications. Our experimental
                  frameworks simultaneously collects control flow,
                  performance counter and live power measurement
                  information. Using this framework, we directly compare
                  between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block
                  vectors") and performance counter techniques for
                  characterizing power phases. Across a collection of
                  both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop
                  applications, our results indicate that both
                  techniques are promising, but that performance
                  counters consistently provide better representation of
                  power behavior. For many of the experimented cases,
                  basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship
                  between the execution path and power
                  consumption. However, there are instances where power
                  behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for
                  example due to differences in memory hierarchy
                  performance. We demonstrate these with examples from
                  real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques
                  offer average classification errors of 1.9\% for SPEC
                  and 7.1\% for other benchmarks, while basic block
                  vectors achieve 2.9\% average errors for SPEC and
                  11.7\% for other benchmarks respectively.},

                  profiling to optimize the configuration of a
                  microprocessor dynamically so as to save power with
                  minimum performance penalty. The configuration of the
                  processor changes according to the parallelism in the
                  running program. Experiments on some benchmark
                  programs show good savings in total energy
                  consumption; we have observed a decrease of up to 23%
                  in energy/cycle and up to 8% in energy per
                  instruction. Our proposed approach can be used for
                  energy-aware computing in either portable applications
                  or in desktop environments where power density is
                  becoming a concern. This approach can also be

	Abstract = {After 15 years of exponential improvement in
                  microprocessor clock rates, the physical principles
                  allowing for Dennard scaling, which enabled
                  performance improvements without a commensurate
                  increase in power consumption, have all but
                  ended. Until now, most HPC systems have not focused on
                  power efficiency. However, as the cost of power
                  reaches parity with capital costs, it is increasingly
                  important to compare systems with metrics based on the
                  sustained performance per watt. Therefore we need to
                  establish practical methods to measure power
                  consumption of such systems in- situ in order to
                  support such metrics. Our study provides power
                  measurements for various computational loads on the
                  largest scale HPC systems ever involved in such an
                  assessment. This study demonstrates clearly that,
                  contrary to conventional wisdom, the power consumed
                  while running the high performance Linpack (HPL)
                  benchmark is very close to the power consumed by any
                  subset of a typical compute-intensive scientific
                  workload. Therefore, HPL, which in most cases cannot
                  serve as a suitable workload for performance
                  measurements, can be used for the purposes of power
                  measurement. Furthermore, we show through measurements
                  on a large scale system that the power consumed by
                  smaller subsets of the system can be projected
                  straightforwardly and accurately to estimate the power
                  consumption of the full system. This allows a less
                  invasive approach for determining the power
                  consumption of large-scale systems.},

                  observed when the processor cache has accumulated some
                  amount of the process state, i.e., data or
                  instructions. Cache affinity is exploited by OS
                  schedulers: they tend to reschedule processes to run
                  on a recently used processor.  On conventional
                  (unicore) multiprocessor systems, exploitation of
                  cache affinity improves performance. It is not yet

                  improvements would be observed on multicore

                  design of efficient multicore scheduling

	Abstract = {Thermal issues are fast becoming major design
                  constraints in high-performance systems. Temperature
                  variations adversely affect system reliability and
                  prompt worst-case design. In recent history,
                  researchers have proposed dynamic thermal-management
                  (DTM) techniques targeting average-case design and
                  tackling the temperature issue at runtime. While past
                  work on DTM has focused on different techniques in
                  isolation, it fails to consider a system-level
                  approach which uses both hardware and software support
                  in a synergistic fashion and hence leads to a
                  significant execution-time overhead. In this paper, we
                  propose HybDTM, a system-level framework for doing
                  fine-grained coordinated thermal management using a
                  hybrid of hardware techniques (like clock gating) and
                  software techniques (like thermal-aware process
                  scheduling), leveraging the advantages of both
                  approaches in a synergistic fashion. We show that
                  while hardware techniques can be used reactively to
                  manage the overall temperature in case of thermal
                  emergencies, proactive use of software techniques can
                  build on top of it to balance the overall thermal
                  profile with minimal overhead using the operating
                  system (OS) support. In order to evaluate our proposed
                  hybrid-DTM policy, we develop a novel regression-based
                  thermal model, providing fast and accurate temperature
                  estimates to do runtime thermal characterization of
                  all applications running on the system, using hardware
                  performance counters available in modern
                  high-performance processors alongside thermal sensors
                  for training the model at runtime. Our model is
                  validated against actual temperature measurements from
                  online thermal sensors, with the average estimation
                  error found to be less than 5\%. We also study
                  system-level DTM issues, jointly considering both the
                  processor and memory, and show how a unified DTM
                  approach can benefit from global knowledge of
                  individual system components. We evaluate our proposed
                  methodology on a desktop system with an Intel
                  Pentium-4 process- or and a modified Linux OS, running
                  a number of SPEC2000 benchmarks, in both uniprocessor
                  and simultaneous multithreaded environments and show
                  that our proposed technique is able to successfully
                  manage the overall temperature with an average
                  execution-time overhead of only 10.4\% (20.1\%
                  maximum) compared to the case without any DTM, as
                  opposed to 23.9\% (46\% maximum) overhead for purely
                  hardware-based DTM. Our system, including the
                  thermal-aware OS, built-in runtime
                  thermal-characterization model, and interface to the

                  levels of on-chip variation, mainly because dynamic
                  thermal management schemes are oblivious to the
                  variation characteristics of the underlying
                  hardware. We propose a technique that utilizes the

	Abstract = {Energy and thermal considerations are increasingly
                  driving system designers to adopt multi-core
                  processors. In this paper, we consider the problem of
                  scheduling periodic real-time tasks on multi-core
                  processors using fixed-priority preemptive
                  scheduling. Specifically, we focus on the partitioned
                  (static binding) approach, which statically allocates
                  tasks to processing cores. The well-established 50\%
                  bound for partitioned multiprocessor scheduling [10]
                  can be overcome by task-splitting (TS) [19], which
                  allows a task to be split across more than one
                  core. We prove that a utilization bound of 60\% per
                  core can be achieved by the partitioned
                  deadline-monotonic scheduling (PDMS) class of
                  algorithms on implicit-deadline task sets, when the
                  highest-priority task on each processing core is
                  allowed to be split (HPTS). Given the widespread usage
                  of fixed-priority scheduling in commercial real-time
                  and non real-time operating systems (e.g. VxWorks,
                  Linux), establishing such utilization bounds is both
                  relevant and useful. We also show that a specific
                  instance of PDMS\_ HPTS, where tasks are allocated in
                  the decreasing order of size, called PDMS\_HPTS\_ DS,
                  has a utilization bound of 65\% on implicit deadline
                  task-sets. The PDMS\_ HPTS\_ DS algorithm also
                  achieves a utilization bound of 69\% on lightweight
                  implicit-deadline task-sets where no single task
                  utilization exceeds 41.4\%. The average-case behavior
                  of PDMS\_ HPTS\_ DS is studied using randomly
                  generated task-sets, and it is seen to have an average
                  schedulable utilization of 88\%. We also characterize
                  the overhead of task-splitting using measurements on
                  an Intel Core 2 Duo processor.},

                  technique. Existing hardware sensors are too costly to
                  implement and add additional heat while software
                  simulations fail to account for all possible hardware
                  effects. In this paper, we describe a software
                  solution for temperature sensing that uses real
                  hardware resources such as performance counters. The
                  resulting temperature model provides a detailed
                  spatial gradient of the processor and executes at
                  runtime. In particular, the model is configured for
                  the Pentium 4 processor. We run SPEC2000 benchmarks to
                  analyze the thermal behavior of applications and
                  explain the potential benefits of using our model for
                  temperature-aware research.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes to develop a system-wide energy
                  consumption model for servers by making use of
                  hardware performance counters and experimental
                  measurements. We develop a real-time energy prediction
                  model that relates server energy consumption to its
                  overall thermal envelope. While previous studies have
                  attempted system-wide modeling of server power
                  consumption through subsystem models, our approach is
                  different in that it uses a small set of tightly
                  correlated parameters to create a model relating
                  system energy input to subsystem energy
                  consumption. We develop a linear regression model that
                  relates processor power, bus activity, and system
                  ambient temperatures into real-time predictions of the
                  power consumption of long jobs and as result
                  controlling their thermal impact. Using the
                  HyperTransport bus model as a case study and through
                  electrical measurements on example server subsystems,
                  we develop a statistical model for estimating run-time
                  power consumption. Our model is accurate within an
                  error of four percent(4\%) as verified using a set of
                  common processor benchmarks.},

	Abstract = {Fairness is an essential requirement of any operating
                  system scheduler. Unfortunately, existing fair
                  scheduling algorithms are either inaccurate or
                  inefficient and non-scalable for multiprocessors. This
                  problem is becoming increasingly severe as the
                  hardware industry continues to produce larger scale
                  multi-core processors. This paper presents Distributed
                  Weighted Round-Robin (DWRR), a new scheduling
                  algorithm that solves this problem. With distributed
                  thread queues and small additional overhead to the
                  underlying scheduler, DWRR achieves high efficiency
                  and scalability. Besides conventional priorities, DWRR
                  enables users to specify weights to threads and
                  achieve accurate proportional CPU sharing with
                  constant error bounds. DWRR operates in concert with
                  existing scheduler policies targeting other system
                  attributes, such as latency and throughput. As a
                  result, it provides a practical solution for various
                  production OSes. To demonstrate the versatility of
                  DWRR,we have implemented it in Linux kernels 2.6.22.15
                  and 2.6.24, which represent two vastly different
                  scheduler designs. Our evaluation shows that DWRR
                  achieves accurate proportional fairness and high
                  performance for a diverse set of workloads.},

	Abstract = {Processor power consumption produces significant heat
                  and can result in higher average operating
                  temperatures. High operating temperatures can lead to
                  reduced reliability and at times thermal emergencies.
                  Previous thermal-aware techniques use dynamic voltage
                  and frequency scaling (DVFS) or multithreaded or
                  multicore process migration to reduce
                  thermals. However, these methods do not gracefully
                  handle scenarios where processors are fully loaded,
                  i.e. there are no free threads or cores for process
                  scheduling. We propose techniques to reduce processor
                  temperature when processors are fully loaded. We use
                  system-level compiler support and dynamic runtime
                  instrumentation to identify the relative thermal
                  intensity of processes. We implement a thermal-aware
                  process scheduling algorithm that reduces processor
                  thermals while maintaining application throughput. We
                  favor ``cool'' processes by reducing time slice
                  allocations for ``hot'' processes.  Results indicate
                  that our thermal-aware scheduling can reduce processor
                  thermals by up to 3 degrees Celsius with little to no
                  loss in application throughput.},

	Abstract = {Task scheduling on multiprocessor computers with
                  dynamically variable voltage and speed is investigated
                  as combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the
                  problem of minimizing schedule length with energy
                  consumption constraint and the problem of minimizing
                  energy consumption with schedule length
                  constraint. The first problem has applications in
                  general multiprocessor computing systems where energy
                  consumption is an important concern and in mobile
                  computers where energy conservation is a main
                  concern. The second problem has applications in
                  real-time multiprocessing systems where timing
                  constraint is a major requirement.  These problems
                  emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance
                  and are defined such that the power-performance
                  product is optimized by fixing one factor and
                  minimizing the other. It is found that both problems
                  are equivalent to the sum of powers problem and can be
                  decomposed into two subproblems, namely, scheduling
                  tasks and determining power supplies. Such
                  decomposition makes design and analysis of heuristic
                  algorithms tractable. We analyze the performance of
                  list scheduling algorithms and equal-speed algorithms
                  and prove that these algorithms are asymptotically
                  optimal. Our extensive simulation data validate our
                  analytical results and provide deeper insight into the

                  presents a Scalable Multiple Server (SMS) architecture
                  design for resource management in a server center,
                  with an emphasis on the proper balance of energy and
                  performance. The goals are to provide different
                  servers for different service sites in a way that
                  automatically adapts to the offered load and improve
                  the energy efficiency of the server pool by
                  dynamically reconfiguring the server pool in
                  accordance with an analytic model. We analyze the
                  power consumption of a Web server as a function of a
                  server's utilization based on experimental arrival
                  data. Two power models such as linear and exponential
                  are shown to fit the experimental arrival data. The
                  linear model is used with a flow-equivalent
                  approximate queuing analysis to minimize power
                  consumption of the Web server. We validated our model
                  by comparing the various working loads generated by a
                  benchmark against measurements. The experimental
                  results demonstrate the calculated values of the model

	Abstract = {With technology advances, the number of cores
                  integrated on a chip and their speed of operation is
                  increasing. This, in turn is leading to a significant
                  increase in chip temperature. Temperature gradients
                  and hot-spots not only affect the performance of the
                  system, but also lead to unreliable circuit operation
                  and affect the life-time of the chip. Meeting the
                  temperature constraints and reducing the hot-spots are
                  critical for achieving reliable and efficient
                  operation of complex multi-core systems. In this work,
                  we present Pro-Temp, a convex optimization based
                  method that pro-actively controls the temperature of
                  the cores, while minimizing the power consumption and
                  satisfying application performance constraints. The
                  method guarantees that the temperature of the cores
                  are below a user- defined threshold at all instances
                  of operation, while also reducing the hot-spots. We
                  perform experiments on several realistic multi-core
                  benchmarks, which show that the proposed method
                  guarantees that the cores never exceed the maximum
                  temperature limit, while matching the application
                  performance requirements. We compare this to
                  traditional methods, where we find several temperature
                  violations during the operation of the system.},

	Abstract = {Inductive noise forces microprocessor designers to
                  sacrifice performance in order to ensure correct and
                  reliable operation of their designs. The possibility
                  of wide fluctuations in supply voltage means that
                  timing margins throughout the processor must be set
                  pessimistically to protect against worst-case droops
                  and surges. While sensor-based reactive schemes have
                  been proposed to deal with voltage noise, inherent
                  sensor delays limit their effectiveness. Instead, this
                  paper describes a voltage emergency predictor that
                  learns the signatures of voltage emergencies (the
                  combinations of control flow and microarchitectural
                  events leading up to them) and uses these signatures
                  to prevent recurrence of the corresponding
                  emergencies. In simulations of a representative
                  superscalar microprocessor in which fluctuations
                  beyond 4\% of nominal voltage are treated as
                  emergencies (an aggressive configuration), these
                  signatures can pinpoint the likelihood of an emergency
                  some 16 cycles ahead of time with 90\% accuracy. This
                  lead time allows machines to operate with much tighter
                  voltage margins (4\% instead of 13\%) and up to 13.5\%
                  higher performance, which closely approaches the
                  14.2\% performance improvement possible with an ideal
                  oracle-based predictor.},

	Abstract = {Today's embedded systems integrate multiple IP cores
                  for processing, communication, and sensing on a single
                  die as systems-on-chip (SoCs).  Aggressive transistor
                  scaling, decreased voltage margins and increased
                  processor power and temperature have made reliability
                  assessment a much more significant issue. Although
                  reliability of devices and interconnect has been
                  broadly studied, in this work, we study a tradeoff
                  between reliability and power consumption for
                  component-based SoC designs. We specifically focus on
                  hard error rates as they cause a device to permanently
                  stop operating. We also present a joint reliability
                  and power management optimization problem whose
                  solution is an optimal management policy. When careful
                  joint policy optimization is performed, we obtain a
                  significant improvement in energy consumption (40\%)
                  in tandem with meeting a reliability constraint for
                  all SoC operating temperatures},

@inproceedings{Rumble2009,
	Abstract = {Energy is the critical limiting resource to mobile
                  computing devices. Correspondingly, an operating
                  system must track, provision, and ration how
                  applications consume energy. The emergence of
                  third-party application stores and marketplaces makes
                  this concern even more pressing. A third-party
                  application must not deny service through excessive,
                  unforeseen energy expenditure, whether accidental or
                  malicious. Previous research has shown promise in
                  tracking energy usage and rationing it to meet device
                  lifetime goals, but such mechanisms and policies are
                  still nascent, especially regarding user
                  interaction. We argue for a new operating system,
                  called Cinder, which builds on top of the HiStar
                  OS. Cinder's energy awareness is based on hierarchical
                  capacitors and task profiles. We introduce and explore
                  these abstractions, paying particular attention to the
                  ways in which policies could be generated and enforced
                  in a dynamic system.},

@article{Stoess2007,
	Abstract = {Current approaches to power management are based on
                  operating systems with full knowledge of and full
                  control over the underlying hardware; the distributed
                  nature of multi-layered virtual machine environments
                  renders such approaches insufficient. In this paper,
                  we present a novel framework for energy management in
                  modular, multi-layered operating system
                  structures. The framework provides a unified model to
                  partition and distribute energy, and mechanisms for
                  energy-aware resource accounting and allocation. As a
                  key property, the framework explicitly takes the
                  recursive energy consumption into account, which is
                  spent, e.g., in the virtualization layer or subsequent
                  driver components. Our prototypical implementation
                  targets hypervisor-based virtual machine systems and
                  comprises two components: a host-level subsystem,
                  which controls machine-wide energy constraints and
                  enforces them among all guest OSes and service
                  components, and, complementary, an energy-aware guest
                  operating system, capable of fine-grained
                  application-specific energy management. Guest level
                  energy management thereby relies on effective
                  virtualization of physical energy effects provided by
                  the virtual machine monitor. Experiments with CPU and
                  disk devices and an external data acquisition system
                  demonstrate that our framework accurately controls and
                  stipulates the power consumption of individual
                  hardware devices, both for energy-aware and
                  energyunaware guest operating systems.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: To improve the prediction accuracy of
                  complex multivariate chaotic time series, a novel
                  scheme formed on the basis of multivariate local
                  polynomial fitting with the optimal kernel function is
                  proposed. According to Takens Theorem, a chaotic time
                  series is reconstructed into vector data, multivariate
                  local polynomial regression is used to fit the
                  predicted complex chaotic system, then the regression
                  model parameters with the least squares method based
                  on embedding dimensions are estimated,and the
                  prediction value is calculated. To evaluate the
                  results, the proposed multivariate chaotic time series
                  predictor based on multivariate local polynomial model
                  is compared with a univariate predictor with the same
                  numerical data. The simulation results obtained by the
                  Lorenz system show that the prediction mean squares
                  error of the multivariate predictor is much smaller
                  than the univariate one, and is much better than the
                  existing three methods. Even if the last half of the

                  real-time system on homogeneous multi-core
                  architecture. To make the best of the available
                  parallelism in these systems, first an application is
                  partitioned into some parallel tasks as much as
                  possible. Then the parallel tasks are dispatched to
                  different cores, so as to execute in parallel. In each
                  core, real-time applications can run concurrently with
                  non-real-time applications. The scheduling
                  architecture uses a two-level scheduling scheme. At
                  the top level, a sporadic server is assigned to each
                  scheduling policy. Each sporadic server is used to
                  schedule the dispatched tasks according to its
                  scheduling policy. At the bottom level, a
                  rate-monotonic OS scheduler is adopted to schedule the
                  top level sporadic servers.},

                  page migration scheme and investigate its impact on
                  the performance of multithreaded applications. We use
                  lightweight, inexpensive plug-in hardware counters to
                  profile the memory access behavior of an application,
                  and then migrate pages to memory local to the most
                  frequently accessing processor. Using the Dyninst
                  runtime instrumentation combined with hardware
                  counters, we were able to add page migration
                  capabilities to the system without having to modify
                  the operating system kernel, or to re-compile
                  application programs. This approach reduced the total
                  number of non-local memory accesses of applications by
                  up to 90%. Even on a system with small remote to local
                  memory access latency rations, this resulted in up to
                  16% improvement in execution time.},

	Abstract = {The Operating System scheduler is designed to allocate
                  the CPU resources appropriately to all processes. The
                  Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) design ensures
                  fairness among tasks using the thread fair scheduling
                  algorithm. This algorithm ensures allocation of
                  resources based on the number of threads in the system
                  and not within executing programs. This can lead to
                  fairness issue in a multi-threaded environment as the
                  Linux scheduler tends to favor programs with higher
                  number of threads. We illustrate the issue of fairness
                  through experimental evaluation thus exposing the
                  weakness of the current allocation scheme where
                  software developers could take advantage by spawning
                  many additional threads in order to obtain more CPU
                  resources. A novel algorithm is proposed as a solution
                  towards achieving better fairness in the Linux
                  scheduler. The algorithm is based on weight
                  readjustment of the threads created in the same
                  process to significantly reduce the unfair allocation
                  of CPU resources in multi-threaded environments. The
                  algorithm was implemented and evaluated. It
                  demonstrated promising results towards solving the
                  raised fairness issue. We conclude this paper
                  highlighting the limitations of the proposed approach

	Abstract = {As power dissipation causes thermal issues in cooling
                  costs, lifetime and reliability, thermal management
                  has become an important issue in today's OS and
                  processor design. Early OS-level thermal management
                  schemes were proposed and evaluated mainly with
                  simulators or analytical models. In this paper, we
                  implement a thermal-aware round-robin scheduling
                  algorithm in the Linux kernel, and compare its
                  performance with the Heat-and-Run' algorithm and the
                  default Linux baseline scheduler on an Intel Core 2
                  Duo processor using representative benchmarks from
                  SPEC2000, MiBench and NetBench. Our results indicate
                  that the current Linux scheduler can easily be
                  enhanced with thermal-awareness to show improved
                  performance in terms of both the on-chip temperature

	Abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by
                  their increasing power consumption and the heat
                  generation speed on-die. High temperature impairs the
                  processor's reliability and reduces its
                  lifetime. While hardware level dynamic thermal
                  management (DTM) techniques, such as voltage and
                  frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip
                  temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold,
                  they inevitably come at the cost of performance
                  degradation. We propose an OS level technique that
                  performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the
                  number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces
                  the amount of hardware DTMs and achieves higher
                  performance while keeping the temperature low. Our
                  methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal
                  behavior among different workloads, and schedule them
                  to keep the chip temperature below a given budget. We
                  develop a heuristic algorithm based on the observation
                  that there is a difference in the resulting
                  temperature when a hot and a cool job are executed in
                  a different order. To evaluate our scheduling
                  algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime
                  temperature monitor to enable informed scheduling
                  decisions. We have implemented our scheduling
                  algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring
                  framework in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler
                  can remove 10.5-73.6\% of the hardware DTMs in various
                  combinations of workloads in a medium thermal
                  environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was
                  improved by up to 7.6\% (4.1\% on average) even under
                  a severe thermal environment.},

	Abstract = {Energy consumption has recently been widely recognized
                  as a major challenge of computer systems design. This
                  paper explores how to support energy as a first-class
                  operating system resource. Energy, because of its
                  global system nature, presents challenges beyond those
                  of conventional resource management. To meet these
                  challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies
                  energy accounting over diverse hardware components and
                  enables fair allocation of available energy among
                  applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery
                  lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to
                  share this limited resource among competing task
                  according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our
                  framework supports explicit control over the battery
                  resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux,
                  that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental
                  results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for
                  the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation,
                  can achieve a target battery lifetime, and
                  proportionally shares the limited energy resource
                  among competing tasks.},

	Abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly popular, from
                  laptops, PDAs, and cell phones to emerging platforms
                  such as wireless sensor networks. Available battery
                  energy has become a critical mobile-system resource. A
                  mobile device's usefulness is often limited not by its
                  hardware's raw speed but by its battery's
                  energy. Energy consumption is a major systems-design
                  challenge. We designed our ECOSystem (Energy-Centric
                  Operating System) prototype to manage energy
                  consumption at the OS level, complementing existing
                  power-management techniques, such as DVS and
                  application adaptation. It's based on the ideas that
                  energy management should be a system-wide effort, that
                  we should explicitly recognize energy as a resource,
                  and that we should unify energy management across the
                  system. Even managing one hardware device might
                  require coordination with other system
                  components. Without unified management,
                  application-level energy-saving efforts might not
                  result in reduced energy consumption. ECOSystem
                  incorporates the "currentcy model", which lets the
                  operating system manage energy as a first-class
                  resource. It can also express complex energy-related
                  goals and behaviors, leading to more effective,
                  unified management policies.},

@article{Zhou2010a,
	Abstract = {A rising horizon in chip fabrication is the 3D
                  integration technology.  It stacks two or more dies
                  vertically with a dense, high-speed interface to
                  increase the device density and reduce the delay of
                  interconnects significantly across the dies. However,
                  a major challenge in 3D technology is the increased
                  power density, which gives rise to the concern of heat
                  dissipation within the processor. High temperatures
                  trigger voltage and frequency throttlings in hardware,
                  which degrade the chip performance. Moreover, high
                  temperatures impair the processor's reliability and
                  reduce its lifetime. To alleviate this problem, we
                  propose in this paper an OS-level scheduling algorithm
                  that performs thermal-aware task scheduling on a 3D
                  chip. Our algorithm leverages the inherent thermal
                  variations within and across different tasks, and
                  schedules them to keep the chip temperature low. We
                  observed that vertically adjacent dies have strong
                  thermal correlations and the scheduler should consider
                  them jointly. Compared with other intuitive algorithms
                  such as a Random and a Round-Robin algorithm, our
                  proposed algorithm brings lower peak temperature and
                  average temperature on-chip.  Moreover, it can remove,
                  on average, 46 percent of thermal emergency time and
                  result in 5.11 percent (4.78 percent) performance
                  improvement over the base case on thermally
                  homogeneous (heterogeneous) floorplans.},
