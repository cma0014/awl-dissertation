Subject: Justification for travel to Vancouver, BC Canada for Hotpower2010

Dear Dean Clark:
This letter provides justification for international
travel to present "Chaotic Attractor Prediction for Server Run-time
Energy Consumption" (authored by myself, Jim Simon and Professor
Nian-Feng Tzeng) at the Hotpower 2010 workshop on October 3rd, 2010 in
Vancouver, British Columbia.  This workshop, co-located with USENIX's
OSDI'10 conference, is the premier gathering of computer science
researchers whose work is focused on power-aware computing.  As such,
the workshop is an opportunity to present research from our University
amongst our peers and promote and enhance the stature of our programs.

Respectfully submitted,
AWL
