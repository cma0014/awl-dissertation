Issue#:	26.1
Source:	Soumik
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
The material is presented without adequate rationale  or
development. 

Comments:
(AWL 08/16/10) First, general comment that could apply just as well to
the comments provided by the reviewer.  Second, much of what is being
presented here, esp. in sections about the chaotic behavior of the time
series is application of the technique, comments more oriented towards

Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
For the Lyapunov exponent, what is the function being differentiated?
and does it hold under all conditions? What are the restrictions on
lambda?

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) No update for the 1PM meeting.

Issue:
  For the Kernel density function, H is supposed to be a positive
  definite matrix (dxd). Is that really true under all cases here? Could
  there have been another Kernel density function? The approaches
  currently mentioned are purely textbook.

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) Certainly, other kernel density functions are possible;
function chosen best fits this space and represents good balance from a
computational standpoint.   Again, time series data fits into the
model... is there a specific counter-example he has in mind disproving
positive definite?   Agreed, the method is purely textbook.  We're not
trying to find a new way to use chaotic time series; what's novel is
using these techniques in this space.

Issue#:	26.4

Date:	08/16/10

Issue:  
- Eq. 13 looks wrong [ should be H^(-1/2) ]

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) Agreed, editing error.

Issue#:	26.5
Source:	Soumik
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
- It is unclear why a local weighted averaging method is being used
  since it is not clear how "local" is local. (akin to doing a local
  convex optimization over a global function trying to find a global
  minima).

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) Not exactly certain what Soumik's is asking at this
point.  Need to discuss with him directly to clarify.

Issue#:	26.7
Source:	Soumik
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
  Given that the function f(x) will be determined off-line, the
  polynomial complexity of  f(x) is only of academic interest and has no
  bearing on the utility of this approach. The Key missing link (if
  there is one), is, how is f(x) connected to the "betas".

Comments:
(AWL 08/16/10):  The function will be determined off-line, however, the
it will be evaluated on-line. Thus, there is some interest in efficiency
of computation.  Also, there is far too much emphasis on
Soumik's part on the regression coefficients.  Yes, they are important
as they map each of the quantities into the energy domain.  Beyond, that
it is unclear as to what he is implying in this case.

Issue#:	26.8

Date:	08/16/10

Issue: 
- Eq 14 is minimized with respect to what? and under what constraints?

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) Under investigation as of 1PM.

****
Issue#:	26.9
Source:	Soumik
Date:	Monday, August 16, 2010

Issue:
- A contour plot of f(x) would be a good indicator of how good f(x) is.

Comments:
(AWL 08-16-2010) OK, will investigate how to add.

Issue#:	26.10

Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
Also, I'd like you to reexamine Eq. (15) and its associated
complexity explanation.  I'm not sure what you stated about
its complexity is clear (or correct).

Comment: 
(AWL 08-16-2010) Need to discuss with Dr. Tzeng.

Issue#:	HP.A.1
Source:	Hotpower2010 Reviewer A: Strong Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
This paper suggests using different regression models and chaotic
theory to predict system energy consumption. This approach treats the
consequence as the reason. A system consumes energy for running
programs. Hence, prediction should be conducted on the behavior of
programs' activities.

Issue#:	HP.A.2
Source:	Hotpower2010 Reviewer A: Strong Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
This paper shows power consumption can be modeled by using
different regression models. This is not a new concept. Many studies
have shown that.

Issue#:	HP.A.3
Source:	Hotpower2010 Reviewer A: Strong Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
This paper does not provide sufficient explanation about what to
do with the prediction results. Also, the paper does not compare the
proposed approach with existing solutions, for example, reactive to
workload demands.

Issue#:	HP.A.4
Source:	Hotpower2010 Reviewer A: Strong Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
The paper does not fit the scope of HowPower well. This paper
should be submitted to a conference on prediction theory or stochastic
modeling.

Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
The writing quality requires improvement. Figure 6 is completely
unreadable. The titles for X and Y axes, as well as the legends are too
small to see.

Issue#:	HP.B.1
Source:	Hotpower1010 Reviewer B: Weak Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
I had a hard time following much of the paper, since it is
heavily focused on modeling and time series analysis. In fact, the
abstract and intro talk a lot about thermal management, but this topic
is essentially forgotten throughout the rest of the paper.

Issue#:	HP.B.2
Source:	Hotpowwe1010 Reviewer B: Weak Reject
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
The results do confirm that the proposed method is better than
the alternatives at predicting power. However, how important are the
small reductions in prediction error? Moreover, no insight is provided
as to why predictions are much better for the AMD-based server than the
Intel-based server.

currently a copy of the same section of Table 1).

Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
How representative is the HPC benchmark you used? to thoroughly
evaluate your technique, it is necessary to exercise all the major
components of system, including the processor, memory, hdd, networking,
bus, power supply etc.

listed in the text (1st paragraph of Sec 3).

Source:	Hotpower2010 Reviewer C: Weak Accept
Date:	08/16/10

Issue:
I also have questions about the complexity of the nonlinear
estimation method, which is more complex than the linear models. I did
not see any emprical data on the time it takes to compute the model.

Issue:
The CAPP models achieve much better results, but it as a
computation overhead. One thing that it is not shown in the paper is the
program phases.

Issue:
Different applications have different chaotic parameters. The
paper find the parameters with a training set. It may be interesting to
find them and adjusting them as the application runs.
