	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {Modern shared memory multiprocessor systems commonly have non-uniform memory access (NUMA) with asymmetric memory bandwidth and latency characteristics. Operating systems now provide application programmer interfaces allowing the user to perform specific thread and memory placement. To date, however, there have been relatively few detailed assessments of the importance of memory/thread placement for complex applications.  This paper outlines a framework for performing memory and thread placement experiments on Solaris and Linux. Thread binding and location specific memory allocation and its verification is discussed and contrasted.    Using the framework, the performance characteristics of serial versions of lmbench, Stream and various BLAS libraries (ATLAS, GOTO, ACML on Opteron/Linux and Sunperf on Opteron, UltraSPARC/Solaris) are measured on two different hardware platforms (UltraSPARC/FirePlane and Opteron/HyperTransport). A simple model describing performance as a function of memory distribution is proposed and assessed for both the Opteron and UltraSPARC.   },

	Title = {{Efficient Power Analysis Using Synthetic Testcases}},
	Year = {6-8 Oct. 2005},
	Abstract = { Power dissipation has become an important consideration for processor designs. Assessing power using simulators is problematic given the long runtimes of real applications. Researchers have responded with techniques to reduce the total number of simulated instructions while still maintaining representative simulation behavior. Synthetic testcases have been shown to reduce the number of necessary instructions significantly while still achieving accurate performance results for many workload characteristics. In this paper, we show that the synthetic testcases can rapidly and accurately assess the dynamic power dissipation of real programs. Synthetic versions of the SPEC2000 and STREAM benchmarks can predict the total power per cycle to within 6.8% error on average, with a maximum of 15% error, and total power per instruction to within 4.4% error. In addition, for many design changes for which IPC and power change significantly, the synthetic testcases show small errors, many less than 5%. We also show that simulated power dissipation for both applications and synthetics correlates well with the IPCs of the real programs, often giving a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9.},

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},

The HPC community needs a Green500 List to rank supercomputers on speed and power requirements and to supplement the TOP500 List. Vendors and system architects worldwide take substantial pride and invest tremendous effort toward making the biannual TOP500 List. We anticipate that the Green500 List effort will do the same and encourage the HPC community and operators of Internet data centers to design more power-efficient supercomputers and large-scale data centers.},

	Abstract = { Execution-driven simulators are often used for power/energy and performance evaluation. Simulators can provide semantic details but they provide insufficient speed and accuracy for compiler and OS research. Physical measurement is fast and objective but lacks a semantic connection between the measurement result and the evaluated program. The objective of our research is to bring together the advantages of simulation and physical measurement to build an infrastructure for power and energy optimization. Power and energy behavior is obtained through physical measurement. Simulation is used for observing the connection between power and energy behavior and the evaluated program. Our preliminary results demonstrate the ability of this infrastructure to capture detailed power behavior of any region of a program. To simplify the power/energy evaluation of programs with long execution times and overcome the limitation of physical devices, we propose using the SimPoints methodology developed by researchers at UC San Diego to find representative slices of a program. Through simulation, we validate the feasibility of the SimPoint idea in simplifying power/energy evaluation. We expect that this infrastructure will help researchers in OS/compiler power/energy optimization to evaluate their optimizations more efficiently and observe more optimization opportunities.},

The HotSpot compact thermal modeling approach is especially well suited for preregister transfer level (RTL) and presynthesis thermal analysis and is able to provide detailed static and transient temperature information across the die and the package, as it is also computationally efficient.},

	Year = {27 Oct. 2003},
	Abstract = { Characterizing program behavior is important for both hardware and software research. Most modern applications exhibit distinctly different behavior throughout their runtimes, which constitute several phases of execution that share a greater amount of resemblance within themselves compared to other regions of execution. These execution phases can occur at very large scales, necessitating prohibitively long simulation times for characterization. Due to the implementation of extensive clock gating and additional power and thermal management techniques in modern processors, these program phases are also reflected in program power behavior, which can be used as an alternative means of program behavior characterization for power-oriented research. In this paper, we present our methodology for identifying phases in program power behavior and determining execution points that correspond to these phases, as well as defining a small set of power signatures representative of overall program power behavior. We define a power similarity metric as an intersection of both magnitude based and ratio-wise similarities in the power dissipation of processor components. We then develop a thresholding algorithm in order to partition the power behavior into similarity groups. We illustrate our methodology with the gzip benchmark for its whole runtime and characterize gzip power behavior with both the selected execution points and defined signature vectors.},

	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},

Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and 11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

The configuration of the processor changes according to the parallelism in the running program. Experiments on some benchmark programs show good savings in total energy consumption; we have observed a decrease of up to 23% in energy/cycle and up to 8% in energy per instruction. Our proposed approach can be used for energy-aware computing in either portable applications or in desktop environments where power density is becoming a concern. This approach can also be incorporated in larger power management strategies like ACPI},

	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {After 15 years of exponential improvement in microprocessor clock rates, the physical principles allowing for Dennard scaling, which enabled performance improvements without a commensurate increase in power consumption, have all but ended. Until now, most HPC systems have not focused on power efficiency. However, as the cost of power reaches parity with capital costs, it is increasingly important to compare systems with metrics based on the sustained performance per watt. Therefore we need to establish practical methods to measure power consumption of such systems in- situ in order to support such metrics. Our study provides power measurements for various computational loads on the largest scale HPC systems ever involved in such an assessment. This study demonstrates clearly that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the power consumed while running the high performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is very close to the power consumed by any subset of a typical compute-intensive scientific workload. Therefore, HPL, which in most cases cannot serve as a suitable workload for performance measurements, can be used for the purposes of power measurement. Furthermore, we show through measurements on a large scale system that the power consumed by smaller subsets of the system can be projected straightforwardly and accurately to estimate the power consumption of the full system. This allows a less invasive approach for determining the power consumption of large-scale systems.},

	Abstract = {Thermal issues are fast becoming major design constraints in high-performance systems. Temperature variations adversely affect system reliability and prompt worst-case design. In recent history, researchers have proposed dynamic thermal-management (DTM) techniques targeting average-case design and tackling the temperature issue at runtime. While past work on DTM has focused on different techniques in isolation, it fails to consider a system-level approach which uses both hardware and software support in a synergistic fashion and hence leads to a significant execution-time overhead. In this paper, we propose HybDTM, a system-level framework for doing fine-grained coordinated thermal management using a hybrid of hardware techniques (like clock gating) and software techniques (like thermal-aware process scheduling), leveraging the advantages of both approaches in a synergistic fashion. We show that while hardware techniques can be used reactively to manage the overall temperature in case of thermal emergencies, proactive use of software techniques can build on top of it to balance the overall thermal profile with minimal overhead using the operating system (OS) support. In order to evaluate our proposed hybrid-DTM policy, we develop a novel regression-based thermal model, providing fast and accurate temperature estimates to do runtime thermal characterization of all applications running on the system, using hardware performance counters available in modern high-performance processors alongside thermal sensors for training the model at runtime. Our model is validated against actual temperature measurements from online thermal sensors, with the average estimation error found to be less than 5\%. We also study system-level DTM issues, jointly considering both the processor and memory, and show how a unified DTM approach can benefit from global knowledge of individual system components. We evaluate our proposed methodology on a desktop system with an Intel Pentium-4 process- or and a modified Linux OS, running a number of SPEC2000 benchmarks, in both uniprocessor and simultaneous multithreaded environments and show that our proposed technique is able to successfully manage the overall temperature with an average execution-time overhead of only 10.4\% (20.1\% maximum) compared to the case without any DTM, as opposed to 23.9\% (46\% maximum) overhead for purely hardware-based DTM. Our system, including the thermal-aware OS, built-in runtime thermal-characterization model, and interface to the underlying hardware using the Pentium-4 processor, is ready for release.},

Providing a cost-effective and detailed temperature sensing mechanism is crucial to effectively employ a thermal management technique. Existing hardware sensors are too costly to implement and add additional heat while software simulations fail to account for all possible hardware effects. In this paper, we describe a software solution for temperature sensing that uses real hardware resources such as performance counters. The resulting temperature model provides a detailed spatial gradient of the processor and executes at runtime. In particular, the model is configured for the Pentium 4 processor. We run SPEC2000 benchmarks to analyze the thermal behavior of applications and explain the potential benefits of using our model for temperature-aware research.},

This paper presents a Scalable Multiple Server (SMS) architecture design for resource management in a server center, with an emphasis on the proper balance of energy and performance. The goals are to provide different servers for different service sites in a way that automatically adapts to the offered load and improve the energy efficiency of the server pool by dynamically reconfiguring the server pool in accordance with an analytic model. We analyze the power consumption of a Web server as a function of a server's utilization based on experimental arrival data. Two power models such as linear and exponential are shown to fit the experimental arrival data. The linear model is used with a flow-equivalent approximate queuing analysis to minimize power consumption of the Web server. We validated our model by comparing the various working loads generated by a benchmark against measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the calculated values of the model tracks and the results generated by real machines. We also tested our SMS architecture by applying it to a real-life Web server center, and achieving a 16.9% reduction in energy consumption.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: To improve the prediction accuracy of complex multivariate chaotic time series, a novel scheme formed on the basis of multivariate local polynomial fitting with the optimal kernel function is proposed. According to Takens Theorem, a chaotic time series is reconstructed into vector data, multivariate local polynomial regression is used to fit the predicted complex chaotic system, then the regression model parameters with the least squares method based on embedding dimensions are estimated,and the prediction value is calculated. To evaluate the results, the proposed multivariate chaotic time series predictor based on multivariate local polynomial model is compared with a univariate predictor with the same numerical data. The simulation results obtained by the Lorenz system show that the prediction mean squares error of the multivariate predictor is much smaller than the univariate one, and is much better than the existing three methods.

	Abstract = { In this paper, we introduce a profile-driven online page migration scheme and investigate its impact on the performance of multithreaded applications. We use lightweight, inexpensive plug-in hardware counters to profile the memory access behavior of an application, and then migrate pages to memory local to the most frequently accessing processor. Using the Dyninst runtime instrumentation combined with hardware counters, we were able to add page migration capabilities to the system without having to modify the operating system kernel, or to re-compile application programs. This approach reduced the total number of non-local memory accesses of applications by up to 90%. Even on a system with small remote to local memory access latency rations, this resulted in up to 16% improvement in execution time.},

	Abstract = {As power dissipation causes thermal issues in cooling costs, lifetime and reliability, thermal management has become an important issue in today's OS and processor design. Early OS-level thermal management schemes were proposed and evaluated mainly with simulators or analytical models. In this paper, we implement a thermal-aware round-robin scheduling algorithm in the Linux kernel, and compare its performance with the  Heat-and-Run' algorithm and the default Linux baseline scheduler on an Intel Core 2 Duo processor using representative benchmarks from SPEC2000, MiBench and NetBench. Our results indicate that the current Linux scheduler can easily be enhanced with thermal-awareness to show improved performance in terms of both the on-chip temperature condition and applicatibon throughput.
