	Abstract = {Modern shared memory multiprocessor systems commonly have non-uniform memory access (NUMA) with asymmetric memory bandwidth and latency characteristics. Operating systems now provide application programmer interfaces allowing the user to perform specific thread and memory placement. To date, however, there have been relatively few detailed assessments of the importance of memory/thread placement for complex applications.  This paper outlines a framework for performing memory and thread placement experiments on Solaris and Linux. Thread binding and location specific memory allocation and its verification is discussed and contrasted.    Using the framework, the performance characteristics of serial versions of lmbench, Stream and various BLAS libraries (ATLAS, GOTO, ACML on Opteron/Linux and Sunperf on Opteron, UltraSPARC/Solaris) are measured on two different hardware platforms (UltraSPARC/FirePlane and Opteron/HyperTransport). A simple model describing performance as a function of memory distribution is proposed and assessed for both the Opteron and UltraSPARC.   },

	Abstract = { In this paper, we introduce a profile-driven online page migration scheme and investigate its impact on the performance of multithreaded applications. We use lightweight, inexpensive plug-in hardware counters to profile the memory access behavior of an application, and then migrate pages to memory local to the most frequently accessing processor. Using the Dyninst runtime instrumentation combined with hardware counters, we were able to add page migration capabilities to the system without having to modify the operating system kernel, or to re-compile application programs. This approach reduced the total number of non-local memory accesses of applications by up to 90%. Even on a system with small remote to local memory access latency rations, this resulted in up to 16% improvement in execution time.},

This paper presents a Scalable Multiple Server (SMS) architecture design for resource management in a server center, with an emphasis on the proper balance of energy and performance. The goals are to provide different servers for different service sites in a way that automatically adapts to the offered load and improve the energy efficiency of the server pool by dynamically reconfiguring the server pool in accordance with an analytic model. We analyze the power consumption of a Web server as a function of a server's utilization based on experimental arrival data. Two power models such as linear and exponential are shown to fit the experimental arrival data. The linear model is used with a flow-equivalent approximate queuing analysis to minimize power consumption of the Web server. We validated our model by comparing the various working loads generated by a benchmark against measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the calculated values of the model tracks and the results generated by real machines. We also tested our SMS architecture by applying it to a real-life Web server center, and achieving a 16.9% reduction in energy consumption.},

	Abstract = { Execution-driven simulators are often used for power/energy and performance evaluation. Simulators can provide semantic details but they provide insufficient speed and accuracy for compiler and OS research. Physical measurement is fast and objective but lacks a semantic connection between the measurement result and the evaluated program. The objective of our research is to bring together the advantages of simulation and physical measurement to build an infrastructure for power and energy optimization. Power and energy behavior is obtained through physical measurement. Simulation is used for observing the connection between power and energy behavior and the evaluated program. Our preliminary results demonstrate the ability of this infrastructure to capture detailed power behavior of any region of a program. To simplify the power/energy evaluation of programs with long execution times and overcome the limitation of physical devices, we propose using the SimPoints methodology developed by researchers at UC San Diego to find representative slices of a program. Through simulation, we validate the feasibility of the SimPoint idea in simplifying power/energy evaluation. We expect that this infrastructure will help researchers in OS/compiler power/energy optimization to evaluate their optimizations more efficiently and observe more optimization opportunities.},

	Year = {27 Oct. 2003},
	Abstract = { Characterizing program behavior is important for both hardware and software research. Most modern applications exhibit distinctly different behavior throughout their runtimes, which constitute several phases of execution that share a greater amount of resemblance within themselves compared to other regions of execution. These execution phases can occur at very large scales, necessitating prohibitively long simulation times for characterization. Due to the implementation of extensive clock gating and additional power and thermal management techniques in modern processors, these program phases are also reflected in program power behavior, which can be used as an alternative means of program behavior characterization for power-oriented research. In this paper, we present our methodology for identifying phases in program power behavior and determining execution points that correspond to these phases, as well as defining a small set of power signatures representative of overall program power behavior. We define a power similarity metric as an intersection of both magnitude based and ratio-wise similarities in the power dissipation of processor components. We then develop a thresholding algorithm in order to partition the power behavior into similarity groups. We illustrate our methodology with the gzip benchmark for its whole runtime and characterize gzip power behavior with both the selected execution points and defined signature vectors.},

	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},

	Title = {Phase characterization for power: evaluating control-flow-based and event-counter-based techniques},
	Year = {11-15 Feb. 2006},
	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases. Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and 11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

	Year = {6-8 Oct. 2005},
	Abstract = { Power dissipation has become an important consideration for processor designs. Assessing power using simulators is problematic given the long runtimes of real applications. Researchers have responded with techniques to reduce the total number of simulated instructions while still maintaining representative simulation behavior. Synthetic testcases have been shown to reduce the number of necessary instructions significantly while still achieving accurate performance results for many workload characteristics. In this paper, we show that the synthetic testcases can rapidly and accurately assess the dynamic power dissipation of real programs. Synthetic versions of the SPEC2000 and STREAM benchmarks can predict the total power per cycle to within 6.8% error on average, with a maximum of 15% error, and total power per instruction to within 4.4% error. In addition, for many design changes for which IPC and power change significantly, the synthetic testcases show small errors, many less than 5%. We also show that simulated power dissipation for both applications and synthetics correlates well with the IPCs of the real programs, often giving a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9.},

Providing a cost-effective and detailed temperature sensing mechanism is crucial to effectively employ a thermal management technique. Existing hardware sensors are too costly to implement and add additional heat while software simulations fail to account for all possible hardware effects. In this paper, we describe a software solution for temperature sensing that uses real hardware resources such as performance counters. The resulting temperature model provides a detailed spatial gradient of the processor and executes at runtime. In particular, the model is configured for the Pentium 4 processor. We run SPEC2000 benchmarks to analyze the thermal behavior of applications and explain the potential benefits of using our model for temperature-aware research.},

	Abstract = { This paper presents HotSpot-a modeling methodology for developing compact thermal models based on the popular stacked-layer packaging scheme in modern very large-scale integration systems. In addition to modeling silicon and packaging layers, HotSpot includes a high-level on-chip interconnect self-heating power and thermal model such that the thermal impacts on interconnects can also be considered during early design stages. The HotSpot compact thermal modeling approach is especially well suited for preregister transfer level (RTL) and presynthesis thermal analysis and is able to provide detailed static and transient temperature information across the die and the package, as it is also computationally efficient.},

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},
