	Abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, elevation in temperatures has brought new challenges in reliability, timing, performance, cooling costs and leakage power. Conventional thermal management techniques sacrifice performance to control the thermal behavior by slowing down or turning off the processors when a critical temperature threshold is exceeded. Moreover, studies have shown that in addition to high temperatures, temporal and spatial variations in temperature impact system reliability. In this work, we explore the benefits of thermally aware task scheduling for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We design and evaluate OS-level dynamic scheduling policies with negligible performance overhead. We show that, using simple to implement policies that make decisions based on temperature measurements, better temporal and spatial thermal profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art schedulers. We also enhance reactive strategies such as dynamic thread migration with our scheduling policies. This way, hot spots and temperature variations are decreased, and the performance cost is significantly reduced},

In this paper, we propose a low-cost temperature management strategy for multicore systems to reduce the adverse effects of hot spots and temperature variations. Our technique utilizes online learning to select the best policy for the current workload characteristics among a given set of expert policies. We achieve 20% and 60% average decrease in the frequency of hot spots and thermal cycles respectively in comparison to the best performing expert, and reduce the spatial gradients to below 5%.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports our 3.75-year empirical study on power-aware operations of Kyoto University's supercomputer system. The supercomputer system of 10 TFlops had required about 540 kW on average in its first fiscal year 2004. After that and one-year try-and-error of power efficient operation, we implemented a simple but effective scheduler of jobs and machine powering to improve the per- load power efficiency by up to 39 % and to save 200 kW and $200,000 electric charge in the fiscal year 2006. The power-aware scheduler tries to minimize the number of active nodes in the system of eleven nodes keeping sufficient computational power for given loads. Thus the power- aware scheduler has not degraded, but has significantly improved, the service quality in terms of the average job- waiting time.},

@article{Kazempour2008,
	Abstract = {Cache affinity between a process and a processor is observed when the processor cache has accumulated some amount of the process state, i.e., data or instructions. Cache affinity is exploited by OS schedulers: they tend to reschedule processes to run on a recently used processor. On conventional (unicore) multiprocessor systems, exploitation of cache affinity improves performance. It is not yet known, however, whether similar performance improvements would be observed on multicore processors. Understanding these effects is crucial for design of efficient multicore scheduling algorithms. Our study analyzes performance effects of cache affinity exploitation on multicore processors. We find that performance improvements on multicoreuniprocessors are not significant. At the same time, performance improvements on multicore multiprocessors are rather pronounced. },

@article{LiD2008,
	Abstract = {Processor power consumption produces significant heat and can result in higher average operating temperatures. High operating temperatures can lead to reduced reliability and at times thermal emergencies. Previous thermal-aware techniques use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) or multithreaded or multicore process migration to reduce thermals. However, these methods do not gracefully handle scenarios where processors are fully loaded, i.e. there are no free threads or cores for process scheduling. We propose techniques to reduce processor temperature when processors are fully loaded. We use system-level compiler support and dynamic runtime instrumentation to identify the relative thermal intensity of processes. We implement a thermal-aware process scheduling algorithm that reduces processor thermals while maintaining application throughput. We favor ``cool'' processes by reducing time slice allocations for ``hot'' processes. Results indicate that our thermal-aware scheduling can reduce processor thermals by up to 3 degrees Celsius with little to no loss in application throughput.},

@article{LiK2008,
	Abstract = {Task scheduling on multiprocessor computers with dynamically variable voltage and speed is investigated as combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the problem of minimizing schedule length with energy consumption constraint and the problem of minimizing energy consumption with schedule length constraint. The first problem has applications in general multiprocessor computing systems where energy consumption is an important concern and in mobile computers where energy conservation is a main concern. The second problem has applications in real-time multiprocessing systems where timing constraint is a major requirement. These problems emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance and are defined such that the power-performance product is optimized by fixing one factor and minimizing the other. It is found that both problems are equivalent to the sum of powers problem and can be decomposed into two subproblems, namely, scheduling tasks and determining power supplies. Such decomposition makes design and analysis of heuristic algorithms tractable. We analyze the performance of list scheduling algorithms and equal-speed algorithms and prove that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Our extensive simulation data validate our analytical results and provide deeper insight into the performance of our heuristic algorithms.},

@article{Yang2008,
	Abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by their increasing power consumption and the heat generation speed on-die. High temperature impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. While hardware level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques, such as voltage and frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold, they inevitably come at the cost of performance degradation. We propose an OS level technique that performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces the amount of hardware DTMs and achieves higher performance while keeping the temperature low. Our methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal behavior among different workloads, and schedule them to keep the chip temperature below a given budget. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the observation that there is a difference in the resulting temperature when a hot and a cool job are executed in a different order. To evaluate our scheduling algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime temperature monitor to enable informed scheduling decisions. We have implemented our scheduling algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring framework in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler can remove 10.5-73.6% of the hardware DTMs in various combinations of workloads in a medium thermal environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was improved by up to 7.6% (4.1% on average) even under a severe thermal environment.},

	Abstract = {Modern shared memory multiprocessor systems commonly have non-uniform memory access (NUMA) with asymmetric memory bandwidth and latency characteristics. Operating systems now provide application programmer interfaces allowing the user to perform specific thread and memory placement. To date, however, there have been relatively few detailed assessments of the importance of memory/thread placement for complex applications.  This paper outlines a framework for performing memory and thread placement experiments on Solaris and Linux. Thread binding and location specific memory allocation and its verification is discussed and contrasted.    Using the framework, the performance characteristics of serial versions of lmbench, Stream and various BLAS libraries (ATLAS, GOTO, ACML on Opteron/Linux and Sunperf on Opteron, UltraSPARC/Solaris) are measured on two different hardware platforms (UltraSPARC/FirePlane and Opteron/HyperTransport). A simple model describing performance as a function of memory distribution is proposed and assessed for both the Opteron and UltraSPARC.   },

	Abstract = { Power dissipation has become an important consideration for processor designs. Assessing power using simulators is problematic given the long runtimes of real applications. Researchers have responded with techniques to reduce the total number of simulated instructions while still maintaining representative simulation behavior. Synthetic testcases have been shown to reduce the number of necessary instructions significantly while still achieving accurate performance results for many workload characteristics. In this paper, we show that the synthetic testcases can rapidly and accurately assess the dynamic power dissipation of real programs. Synthetic versions of the SPEC2000 and STREAM benchmarks can predict the total power per cycle to within 6.8% error on average, with a maximum of 15% error, and total power per instruction to within 4.4% error. In addition, for many design changes for which IPC and power change significantly, the synthetic testcases show small errors, many less than 5%. We also show that simulated power dissipation for both applications and synthetics correlates well with the IPCs of the real programs, often giving a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9.},

	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},

Without fundamental change in the design of supercomputing systems, the performance advances common over the past two decades won't continue.

Vendors and system architects worldwide take substantial pride and invest tremendous effort toward making the biannual TOP500 List.

	Abstract = { Execution-driven simulators are often used for power/energy and performance evaluation. Simulators can provide semantic details but they provide insufficient speed and accuracy for compiler and OS research. Physical measurement is fast and objective but lacks a semantic connection between the measurement result and the evaluated program. The objective of our research is to bring together the advantages of simulation and physical measurement to build an infrastructure for power and energy optimization. Power and energy behavior is obtained through physical measurement. Simulation is used for observing the connection between power and energy behavior and the evaluated program. Our preliminary results demonstrate the ability of this infrastructure to capture detailed power behavior of any region of a program. To simplify the power/energy evaluation of programs with long execution times and overcome the limitation of physical devices, we propose using the SimPoints methodology developed by researchers at UC San Diego to find representative slices of a program. Through simulation, we validate the feasibility of the SimPoint idea in simplifying power/energy evaluation. We expect that this infrastructure will help researchers in OS/compiler power/energy optimization to evaluate their optimizations more efficiently and observe more optimization opportunities.},

	Abstract = { Characterizing program behavior is important for both hardware and software research. Most modern applications exhibit distinctly different behavior throughout their runtimes, which constitute several phases of execution that share a greater amount of resemblance within themselves compared to other regions of execution. These execution phases can occur at very large scales, necessitating prohibitively long simulation times for characterization. Due to the implementation of extensive clock gating and additional power and thermal management techniques in modern processors, these program phases are also reflected in program power behavior, which can be used as an alternative means of program behavior characterization for power-oriented research. In this paper, we present our methodology for identifying phases in program power behavior and determining execution points that correspond to these phases, as well as defining a small set of power signatures representative of overall program power behavior. We define a power similarity metric as an intersection of both magnitude based and ratio-wise similarities in the power dissipation of processor components. We then develop a thresholding algorithm in order to partition the power behavior into similarity groups. We illustrate our methodology with the gzip benchmark for its whole runtime and characterize gzip power behavior with both the selected execution points and defined signature vectors.},

	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},

@article{Isci2006,
	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases. Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and 11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

@article{Kamil2008,
	Abstract = {After 15 years of exponential improvement in microprocessor clock rates, the physical principles allowing for Dennard scaling, which enabled performance improvements without a commensurate increase in power consumption, have all but ended. Until now, most HPC systems have not focused on power efficiency. However, as the cost of power reaches parity with capital costs, it is increasingly important to compare systems with metrics based on the sustained performance per watt. Therefore we need to establish practical methods to measure power consumption of such systems in- situ in order to support such metrics. Our study provides power measurements for various computational loads on the largest scale HPC systems ever involved in such an assessment. This study demonstrates clearly that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the power consumed while running the high performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is very close to the power consumed by any subset of a typical compute-intensive scientific workload. Therefore, HPL, which in most cases cannot serve as a suitable workload for performance measurements, can be used for the purposes of power measurement. Furthermore, we show through measurements on a large scale system that the power consumed by smaller subsets of the system can be projected straightforwardly and accurately to estimate the power consumption of the full system. This allows a less invasive approach for determining the power consumption of large-scale systems.},

@article{Kumar2008,
	Abstract = {Thermal issues are fast becoming major design constraints in high-performance systems. Temperature variations adversely affect system reliability and prompt worst-case design. In recent history, researchers have proposed dynamic thermal-management (DTM) techniques targeting average-case design and tackling the temperature issue at runtime. While past work on DTM has focused on different techniques in isolation, it fails to consider a system-level approach which uses both hardware and software support in a synergistic fashion and hence leads to a significant execution-time overhead. In this paper, we propose HybDTM, a system-level framework for doing fine-grained coordinated thermal management using a hybrid of hardware techniques (like clock gating) and software techniques (like thermal-aware process scheduling), leveraging the advantages of both approaches in a synergistic fashion. We show that while hardware techniques can be used reactively to manage the overall temperature in case of thermal emergencies, proactive use of software techniques can build on top of it to balance the overall thermal profile with minimal overhead using the operating system (OS) support. In order to evaluate our proposed hybrid-DTM policy, we develop a novel regression-based thermal model, providing fast and accurate temperature estimates to do runtime thermal characterization of all applications running on the system, using hardware performance counters available in modern high-performance processors alongside thermal sensors for training the model at runtime. Our model is validated against actual temperature measurements from online thermal sensors, with the average estimation error found to be less than 5\%. We also study system-level DTM issues, jointly considering both the processor and memory, and show how a unified DTM approach can benefit from global knowledge of individual system components. We evaluate our proposed methodology on a desktop system with an Intel Pentium-4 process- or and a modified Linux OS, running a number of SPEC2000 benchmarks, in both uniprocessor and simultaneous multithreaded environments and show that our proposed technique is able to successfully manage the overall temperature with an average execution-time overhead of only 10.4\% (20.1\% maximum) compared to the case without any DTM, as opposed to 23.9\% (46\% maximum) overhead for purely hardware-based DTM. Our system, including the thermal-aware OS, built-in runtime thermal-characterization model, and interface to the underlying hardware using the Pentium-4 processor, is ready for release.},

The resulting temperature model provides a detailed spatial gradient of the processor and executes at runtime. In particular, the model is configured for the Pentium 4 processor.

	Abstract = {An Internet server center provides multiple service sites by means of a multiple server pool. This paper presents a Scalable Multiple Server (SMS) architecture design for resource management in a server center, with an emphasis on the proper balance of energy and performance. The goals are to provide different servers for different service sites in a way that automatically adapts to the offered load and improve the energy efficiency of the server pool by dynamically reconfiguring the server pool in accordance with an analytic model. We analyze the power consumption of a Web server as a function of a server's utilization based on experimental arrival data. Two power models such as linear and exponential are shown to fit the experimental arrival data. The linear model is used with a flow-equivalent approximate queuing analysis to minimize power consumption of the Web server. We validated our model by comparing the various working loads generated by a benchmark against measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the calculated values of the model tracks and the results generated by real machines. We also tested our SMS architecture by applying it to a real-life Web server center, and achieving a 16.9% reduction in energy consumption.},

@article{Tikir2004,
	Abstract = { In this paper, we introduce a profile-driven online page migration scheme and investigate its impact on the performance of multithreaded applications. We use lightweight, inexpensive plug-in hardware counters to profile the memory access behavior of an application, and then migrate pages to memory local to the most frequently accessing processor. Using the Dyninst runtime instrumentation combined with hardware counters, we were able to add page migration capabilities to the system without having to modify the operating system kernel, or to re-compile application programs. This approach reduced the total number of non-local memory accesses of applications by up to 90%. Even on a system with small remote to local memory access latency rations, this resulted in up to 16% improvement in execution time.},

	Abstract = { This paper studies the impact of L2 cache sharing on threads that simultaneously share the cache, on a chip multi-processor (CMP) architecture. Cache sharing impacts threads nonuniformly, where some threads may be slowed down significantly, while others are not. This may cause severe performance problems such as sub-optimal throughput, cache thrashing, and thread starvation for threads that fail to occupy sufficient cache space to make good progress. Unfortunately, there is no existing model that allows extensive investigation of the impact of cache sharing. To allow such a study, we propose three performance models that predict the impact of cache sharing on co-scheduled threads. The input to our models is the isolated L2 cache stack distance or circular sequence profile of each thread, which can be easily obtained on-line or off-line. The output of the models is the number of extra L2 cache misses for each thread due to cache sharing. The models differ by their complexity and prediction accuracy. We validate the models against a cycle-accurate simulation that implements a dual-core CMP architecture, on fourteen pairs of mostly SPEC benchmarks. The most accurate model, the inductive probability model, achieves an average error of only 3.9%. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of the model, a case study that details the relationship between an application's temporal reuse behavior and its cache sharing impact is presented.},

The more complex the application, the greater the volume of instructions and data involved, and hence, the greater the significance of issues involving power-efficient storage and retrieval of these instructions and data. In this chapter we give a brief overview of how memory architecture and accesses affect system power dissipation, and some recent proposals on reducing memory-related power through diverse mechanisms: optimisations of the traditional cache memory system, architectural innovations targeting application specific designs, compiler optimisations, and other techniques. },

Although combining these techniques can save more energy, there has not been much work focused on energy-optimal combination of these techniques under variable memory clock frequencies. In this paper, we explore system-wide energy-optimal frequency space for a memory-aware DVS technique based on a stochastic memory access model for systems with frequency-variable memory devices. In addition, we propose a simple but practical DVS method, which can be applied to an actual platform.},

@article{Fan2005,
	Abstract = {Energy consumption is becoming a limiting factor in the development of computer systems for a range of application domains. Since processor performance comes with a high power cost, there is increased interest in scaling the CPU voltage and clock frequency. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) is the technique for exploiting hardware capabilities to select an appropriate clock rate and voltage to meet application requirements at the lowest energy cost. Unfortunately, the power and performance contributions of other system components, in particular memory, complicate some of the simple assumptions upon which most DVS algorithms are based. We show that there is a positive synergistic effect between DVS and power-aware memories that can transition into lower power states. This combination can offer greater energy savings than either technique alone (89% vs. 39% and 54%). We argue that memory-based criteria---information that is available in commonly provided hardware counters---are important factors for effective speed-setting in DVS algorithms and we develop a technique to estimate overall energy consumption based on them.
