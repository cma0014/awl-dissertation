* TODO Comparison TAS performance against results in [Merkel2010] :Reviewer1:
* DONE Address reviewer's request to clarify Figure 1 		  :Reviewer1:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 22:21] \\
    Addressed by moving discussion about structure to implementation section.
* DONE Add clarification from main paper re: streamcluster performance :Reviewer1:Reviewer5:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 09:22] \\
    1. Add EDP metrics for PARSEC
    2. Use EDP results + information from [Merkel2010] to note the cache
       behavior of streamcluster.
* TODO Address reviewer's concern re: disconnection with [Lewis2010] :Reviewer3:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 22:21] \\
    Not certain exactly what the reviewer is implying with this comment.
* DONE Discussion about complexity of hacking into FreeBSD code.  :Reviewer3:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 09:20] \\
    1. Moved discussion about structure to implementation section. 
    2. Add figure with results from running single SPEC benchmarks showing
       same run time. 
    3. Add discussion describing figure.
* DONE Additional discussion re: thermal model callibration	  :Reviewer3:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 21:28] \\
    I suspect the reviewer was confused by non-traditional use of the word
    "applications" in describing the use cases used for training purposes.
    So, I've revised the text to use "scenario" as an alternative.
* TODO More discussion about differ from prior art		  :Reviewer5:
* TODO Clarify discussion in Sec. IID re. contention wrt DVFS	  :Reviewer5:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 22:48] \\
    After some thought, don't agree with the reviewer on this topic.
* TODO Reviewer rejects claim about OS tick for core temp rise, revisit.  :Reviewer5:
* TODO Additional detail requested explaining Eqns. 3 and 4	  :Reviewer5:
* DONE Clarify purpose of idle queue				  :Reviewer5:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 22:47] \\
    Additional text added in attempt to clarify.
* DONE Is there more than one thread balancing on each tick? 	  :Reviewer5:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 09:24] \\
    1. Add thread balancing figure from main document.
    2. Add text to discussion noting that we move multiple threads.
* TODO Clarify that temp. reduction numbers from physical sensor measurement. :Reviewer5:
  - Note taken on [2012-05-02 Wed 22:19] \\
    Specific comment added to Experiment Setup section noting that data was
    collected from on-die sensors using the coretemp kernel extension.
