	Abstract = { This paper presents HotSpot-a modeling methodology for developing compact thermal models based on the popular stacked-layer packaging scheme in modern very large-scale integration systems. In addition to modeling silicon and packaging layers, HotSpot includes a high-level on-chip interconnect self-heating power and thermal model such that the thermal impacts on interconnects can also be considered during early design stages. The HotSpot compact thermal modeling approach is especially well suited for preregister transfer level (RTL) and presynthesis thermal analysis and is able to provide detailed static and transient temperature information across the die and the package, as it is also computationally efficient.},

@inproceedings{CurtisMaury2006,
	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},

@article{Sazeides1997,
	Abstract = {The predictability of data values is studied at a fundamental level. Two basic predictor models are defined: Computational predictors perform an operation on previous values to yield predicted next values. Examples we study are stride value prediction (which adds a delta to a previous value) and last value prediction (which performs the trivial identity operation on the previous value); Context Based predictors match recent value history (context) with previous value history and predict values based entirely on previously observed patterns. To understand the potential of value prediction we perform simulations with unbounded prediction tables that are immediately updated using correct data values. Simulations of integer SPEC95 benchmarks show that data values can be highly predictable. Best performance is obtained with context based predictors; overall prediction accuracies are between 56% and 91%. The context based predictor typically has an accuracy about 20% better than the computational predictors (last value and stride). Comparison of context based prediction and stride prediction shows that the higher accuracy of context based prediction is due to relatively few static instructions giving large improvements; this suggests the usefulness of hybrid predictors. Among different instruction types, predictability varies significantly. In general, load and shift instructions are more difficult to predict correctly, whereas add instructions are more predictable.},

@article{Joseph1999,
	Abstract = {Prefetching is one approach to reducing the latency of memory operations in modern computer systems. In this paper, we describe the Markov prefetcher. This prefetcher acts as an interface between the on-chip and off-chip cache and can be added to existing computer designs. The Markov prefetcher is distinguished by prefetching multiple reference predictions from the memory subsystem, and then prioritizing the delivery of those references to the processor. This design results in a prefetching system that provides good coverage, is accurate, and produces timely results that can be effectively used by the processor. We also explored a range of techniques that can be used to reduce the bandwidth demands of prefetching, leading to improved memory system performance. In our cycle-level simulations, the Markov Prefetcher reduces the overall execution stalls due to instruction and data memory operations by an average of 54 percent for various commercial benchmarks while only using two-thirds the memory of a demand-fetch cache organization.},
