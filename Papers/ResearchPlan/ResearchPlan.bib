	Abstract = {Execution-driven simulators are often used for power/energy and performance evaluation. Simulators can provide semantic details but they provide insufficient speed and accuracy for compiler and OS research. Physical measurement is fast and objective but lacks a semantic connection between the measurement result and the evaluated program. The objective of our research is to bring together the advantages of simulation and physical measurement to build an infrastructure for power and energy optimization. Power and energy behavior is obtained through physical measurement. Simulation is used for observing the connection between power and energy behavior and the evaluated program. Our preliminary results demonstrate the ability of this infrastructure to capture detailed power behavior of any region of a program. To simplify the power/energy evaluation of programs with long execution times and overcome the limitation of physical devices, we propose using the SimPoints methodology developed by researchers at UC San Diego to find representative slices of a program. Through simulation, we validate the feasibility of the SimPoint idea in simplifying power/energy evaluation. We expect that this infrastructure will help researchers in OS/compiler power/energy optimization to evaluate their optimizations more efficiently and observe more optimization opportunities.},

	Abstract = {One unintended effect of the growth of the Internet
is increased energy usage by servers and the infras-
tructure supporting them. This paper promotes a
research agenda to improve the energy e ciency of
Internet server sites. This goal is timely as the costs
of energy usage and our vulnerability to energy sup-
ply disruptions become increasingly evident.

In particular, we propose energy-conscious server
switching as one approach to improving e ciency
of server clusters at low request loads. Our pro-
posal builds on the commercial acceptance of load-
balancing server switches and recent industry ini-
tiatives to reduce power drain of computer systems
running below their peak loads. The potential sav-
ings from this technique are compelling given that
Internet service loads fluctuate by up to an order of
magnitude at all time scales.},
	Annote = {The key point of this article is:
Improve energy efficiency in clusters by monitoring load concentraing request traffic on the smallest set of servers that can handle the load and throttle the rest.

Energy efficiency in data center.
Concentrate workload on smallest set that can address SLA

	Abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

	Abstract = {Previous proposals for power-aware thread-level parallelism on chip multiprocessos (CMPs) mostly focus on multiprogrammed workloads.  Nonetheless, parallel computation of a single applicaiton is critical in light of the expanding performance demands of important future workloads.  This work addresses the problem of dynamically optimizing power consumption of a parallel application that executes on a many-core CMP under a given performance constraint.  The optimization space is two-dimensional, allowing chagnes in the number of active processors and applying dynamic voltage/frequency scaling.  We demonstrate that the particular optimum operating point dpends nontrivally on the power-performance characteristics of the CMP, the application's behavior, and the particular performance target.  We present simple, low-overhead heuristics for dynamic optimization that significantly cut down on the search effort along both dimensions of the optimization space.  In our evaluation of several parallel applications with different performance targets, these heuristics quickly lock on a configuration that yields optimal power savings in virtually all cases.}}

	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {Performance tuning of high performance numerical code is an important process which is still largely performed manually.

While recent research in automated performance tuning has proposed run-time application configuration and compilation, most compilers in use today do not support such run-time features. As a result, a performance tuner's role is limited to selecting the right compiler optimizations for a given application and environment in which the application runs.

Because many compiler optimizations do not give performance benefits in all cases, performance tuners must tediously test each optimization on their applications under a wide range of scenarios.  Therefore, it is desirable to automate compiler optimization selection in order to avoid or at least reduce the tuning effort.

This thesis deals with the question of whether machine learning techniques can be used to automate compiler optimization selection. It presents a case study in which an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Decision Tree (DT) are constructed, trained, and used to predict whether, for a given loop nest in a shared memory parallel program, loop unrolling optimization should be applied or not. Simple characteristics of the loop nests, such as the nesting level, iteration count, and body size, are collected and used as input to the ANN or DT. The ANN and DT were trained with loop nests from some OpenMP-based NAS parallel benchmarks, and are used to predict the benefit of loop unrolling across different benchmarks, and across different numbers of parallel threads.

Various training methods were tried, and in the best case,  ANN predicts correctly whether loop unrolling is beneficial in 62\% of the cases, whereas DT predicts correctly whether loop unrolling is beneficial in 56\% of the cases. Although the results show promise, we believe that to accurately automate compiler optimization selection, many other factors may need to be taken into account in characterizing each loop nest, due to complex interactions of loop unrolling  with memory hierarchy, data layout, thread partitioning, and instruction-level parallelism.

	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},

	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {Applications on today's high-end systems typically make varying load demands over time. A single application may have many different phases during its lifetime, and workload mixes show interleaved phases. Memory-intensive work or phases may exhibit performance saturation at frequencies below the maximum possible for the processors due to the disparity between processor and memory speeds. Performance saturation is a sign of over-provisioning and leads to energy-inefficient systems. Computers using heterogeneous processors, with the same ISA, but different implementation details, have been proposed as a way of reducing power while avoiding or limiting performance degradation. However, using heterogeneous processors effectively is complicated and requires intelligent schedulingThe research reported here explores the use of a heterogeneous system of processors with identical ISAs and implementation details, but with differing voltages and frequencies. The scheduler uses the execution characteristics of each application to predict its future processing needs and then schedule it to a processor which matches those needs if one is available. The predictions are used to minimize the performance loss to the system as a whole rather than that of a single application. The result limits system power while minimizing total performance loss. A prototype implementation on a Power4 four-processor system is presented. The prototype scheduler is validated using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. The prototype shows reasonable predictor accuracy and significant power savings for memory-bound applications},

                  (Dynamic Frequency Scaling) technique using the performance
                  counters that is already embedded in the commercial
                  microprocessors. By using performance counters and simple
                  regression analysis, we can predict the localized
                  temperature and efficiently schedule the tasks considering
                  the temperature. The proposed technique is especially
                  beneficial to potential localized thermal problems that are
                  inevitable due to limited number of costly CMOS thermal
                  sensors. When localized thermal problems that were not
                  detected by thermal sensors are found after fabrication, the
                  thermal problems can be avoided by the proposed software
                  solution without re-fabrication costs. The evaluation
                  results show that the proposed technique is comparable to
                  the DFS technique using CMOS thermal sensors.  },

	Abstract = {The genetic algorithm has, to date, been applied to a wide
                  range of problems. It is an ideal tool to solve problem in
                  need of multiple, often interdependent requirements. This is
                  because it has the ability to search within a large solution
                  space while at the same time meeting criteria and
                  constraints within the problem's boundaries. In this paper,
                  we apply this heuristic to the problem of multiprocessor
                  task scheduling - assigning a group of predefined tasks to a
                  set of predefined processors. This task execution should
                  take a minimum amount of time while taking into account
                  certain constraints - e.g., prerequisite constraints between
                  the tasks. Aside from using the genetic algorithm, we
                  incorporate a local search method called a memetic within
                  the genetic algorithm as a global search. Since the tasks
                  are operating in a multiprocessor environment, we also
                  attempt to reduce processor temperature by reducing the
                  total power consumption and load balancing amongst the
                  processors.},

	Abstract = {With high-end systems featuring multicore/multithreaded processors and high component density, power-aware high-performance multithreading libraries become a critical element of the system software stack. Online power and performance adaptation of multithreaded code from within user-level runtime libraries is a relatively new and unexplored area of research. We present a user-level library framework for nearly optimal online adaptation of multithreaded codes for low-power, high-performance execution. Our framework operates by regulating concurrency and changing the processors/threads configuration as the program executes. It is innovative in that it uses fast, runtime performance prediction derived from hardware event-driven profiling, to select thread granularities that achieve nearly optimal energy-efficiency points. The use of predictors substantially reduces the runtime cost of granularity control and program adaptation. Our framework achieves performance and ED2 (energy-delay-squared) levels which are: i) comparable to or better than those of oracle-derived offline predictors; ii) significantly better than those of online predictors using exhaustive or localized linear search. The complete prediction and adaptation framework is implemented on a real multi-SMT system with Intel Hyperthreaded processors and embeds adaptation capabilities in OpenMP programs.},
