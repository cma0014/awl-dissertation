Assumption:
The temperature of the physical hardware is directly related to workload
applied to the machine as measured by the physical sensors and internal
counters in the physical operating system.

10 Theses:
1.
There exists a linear relationship between the application workload within a
domainU machine and the physical workload experienced by the domain0 machine.

2.
The physical load experienced by the domain0 machine can be determined by the
amount of work required to virtualize the devices in each domainU.

3.
The virtual I/O workload can be measured through instrumentation in the
hypervisor.

4.
The virtual I/O workload can be considered to be same as the overhead
introduced by virtualization of the application server.

5.
The total workload introduced by virtualization on the domain0 can be modeled
by the summation of all workload from all domainU machines running on that
single domain0 machine.

6.
The workload introduced by the hypervisor into the domain0 machine is a single
component of the overall workload on the domain0 machine.

7.
The workload introduced by the hypervisor into the domain0 machine is the
significant contributor to the overall physical workload when serving
application servers (web services, databases).

8.
Removing the workload from the physical machine by migrating the loaded
service to a "cooler" machine in the cluster will result in less load on the
physical machine.

9.
Reduced load on the physical machine will result in an overall temperature
reduction on the physical machine.

10.
Moving processing to cooler regions of the cluster will distribute the thermal
load across the cluster and thus resulting in a lower steady state temperature
for the entire cluster.
