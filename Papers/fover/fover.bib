	Abstract = {Xen virtualization technology - available for the Linux
                  kernl - is designed to consolidate multiple operating
                  systems to run on a singel server, normalize hardware
                  accessed by the operating systems, isolate misbehaving
                  applications, migrate running OS instances from one physical
                  server to another.  This article provieds an overview of the
                  Xen 3.0 architecture and how it is expected to utilize Intel
                  Virtulaization Technology to enhance manageability and
                  optimize resource utilization in Linux environments.}}

	Abstract = {Data centers typically host clusters of hundreds and
                  sometimes thousands of servers. Power and energy consumption
                  have thus become key concerns in data centers. Realizing the
                  differences between portable and server-class workloads and
                  operating environments, researchers have developed
                  server-specific management strategies. Despite these
                  efforts, much must still be done. In addition to conserving
                  power and energy in heterogeneous server clusters composed
                  of a combination of traditional and blade servers, the
                  authors and their colleagues also seek to enforce limits on
                  the power each server consumes.},
