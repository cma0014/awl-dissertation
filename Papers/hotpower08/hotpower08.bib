Using a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulator, we simulated these modules to predict their junction temperature. A detailed simulation model and power calculation procedures are described. Simulation results are provided for different conditions and parameter variations. Also, thermal measurements of these modules were carried out in real systems. The simulation and measured data were compared, and the results proved that the simulation model was sufficiently accurate for use in memory subsystem thermal design. Using the proposed simulation model of these modules and analysis results, the minimum requirements were defined for avoiding thermal problems in newly designed memory modules.},

	Title = {{Phase Characterization for Power: Evaluating Control-flow-based and Event-counter-based Techniques}},
	Year = {11-15 Feb. 2006},
	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases. Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and 11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

	Title = {{Identifying Program Power Phase Behavior Using Power Vectors}},
	Year = {2003},
	Abstract = { Characterizing program behavior is important for both hardware and software research. Most modern applications exhibit distinctly different behavior throughout their runtimes, which constitute several phases of execution that share a greater amount of resemblance within themselves compared to other regions of execution. These execution phases can occur at very large scales, necessitating prohibitively long simulation times for characterization. Due to the implementation of extensive clock gating and additional power and thermal management techniques in modern processors, these program phases are also reflected in program power behavior, which can be used as an alternative means of program behavior characterization for power-oriented research. In this paper, we present our methodology for identifying phases in program power behavior and determining execution points that correspond to these phases, as well as defining a small set of power signatures representative of overall program power behavior. We define a power similarity metric as an intersection of both magnitude based and ratio-wise similarities in the power dissipation of processor components. We then develop a thresholding algorithm in order to partition the power behavior into similarity groups. We illustrate our methodology with the gzip benchmark for its whole runtime and characterize gzip power behavior with both the selected execution points and defined signature vectors.},

	Year = {3-5 Dec. 2003},
	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},
