Proactive Thermal Load Balancing Based on Thread Energy Consumption Prediction for High-Performance Systems

Central to Power management techniques for mobile and desktop computers are not always appropriate for real-time and high-performance computing applications. Workloads common to high-performance computing fully utilize available processor resources with the result that few resources are available for reactive scheduling. As the server workload increases, so does the thermal stress on the server processors. Modern processors mostly manage this problem through Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) where the processor monitors the die temperature and applies Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) schemes to reduce processor voltage/frequency, thereby reducing power consumption and thermal impact. However, DVFS methods entail a heavy cost from both a performance and reliability standpoint. 

In this paper we introduce a proactive policy-based thermal load balancing scheduler, that uses a full-system thermal and power model to predict hazardous thermal events. The dataflow-based systemwide model estimates the energy consumption and thermal impact of an application during its execution. The knowledge of this predictive thermal status of the processor allows the scheduler time to migrate threads and applications to cooler, underutilized cores. The model uses key micro-architectural event counters and operating system kernel statistics to keep track of workload related activity within the processor and associated peripherals.

The scheduler uses the temperature estimates to adjust the load-balancing policies in the scheduler so as to minimize the number of DTM events.  The analytical model and the scheduler performance is evaluated by extending an existing power-aware scheduler that is part of the OpenSolaris operating system, executed on an AMD Opteron processor. A subset of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite is used to simulate application server workloads.
