@article{Coskun2007,
	Abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, elevation in temperatures has brought new challenges in reliability, timing, performance, cooling costs and leakage power. Conventional thermal management techniques sacrifice performance to control the thermal behavior by slowing down or turning off the processors when a critical temperature threshold is exceeded. Moreover, studies have shown that in addition to high temperatures, temporal and spatial variations in temperature impact system reliability. In this work, we explore the benefits of thermally aware task scheduling for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We design and evaluate OS-level dynamic scheduling policies with negligible performance overhead. We show that, using simple to implement policies that make decisions based on temperature measurements, better temporal and spatial thermal profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art schedulers. We also enhance reactive strategies such as dynamic thread migration with our scheduling policies. This way, hot spots and temperature variations are decreased, and the performance cost is significantly reduced},

In this paper, we propose a low-cost temperature management strategy for multicore systems to reduce the adverse effects of hot spots and temperature variations. Our technique utilizes online learning to select the best policy for the current workload characteristics among a given set of expert policies. We achieve 20% and 60% average decrease in the frequency of hot spots and thermal cycles respectively in comparison to the best performing expert, and reduce the spatial gradients to below 5%.},

The supercomputer system of 10 TFlops had required about 540 kW on average in its first fiscal year 2004. After that and one-year try-and-error of power efficient operation, we implemented a simple but effective scheduler of jobs and machine powering to improve the per- load power efficiency by up to 39 % and to save 200 kW and $200,000 electric charge in the fiscal year 2006. The power-aware scheduler tries to minimize the number of active nodes in the system of eleven nodes keeping sufficient computational power for given loads. Thus the power- aware scheduler has not degraded, but has significantly improved, the service quality in terms of the average job- waiting time.},

	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour. Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},

@article{Isci2006,
	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases. Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored. Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications, our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that performance counters consistently provide better representation of power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks, while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and 11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

	Abstract = {Cache affinity between a process and a processor is observed when the processor cache has accumulated some amount of the process state, i.e., data or instructions. Cache affinity is exploited by OS schedulers: they tend to reschedule processes to run on a recently used processor. On conventional (unicore) multiprocessor systems, exploitation of cache affinity improves performance. It is not yet known, however, whether similar performance improvements would be observed on multicore processors. Understanding these effects is crucial for design of efficient multicore scheduling algorithms. Our study analyzes performance effects of cache affinity exploitation on multicore processors. We find that performance improvements on multicoreuniprocessors are not significant. At the same time, performance improvements on multicore multiprocessors are rather pronounced. },

	Abstract = {Task scheduling on multiprocessor computers with dynamically variable voltage and speed is investigated as combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the problem of minimizing schedule length with energy consumption constraint and the problem of minimizing energy consumption with schedule length constraint. The first problem has applications in general multiprocessor computing systems where energy consumption is an important concern and in mobile computers where energy conservation is a main concern. The second problem has applications in real-time multiprocessing systems where timing constraint is a major requirement. These problems emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance and are defined such that the power-performance product is optimized by fixing one factor and minimizing the other. It is found that both problems are equivalent to the sum of powers problem and can be decomposed into two subproblems, namely, scheduling tasks and determining power supplies. Such decomposition makes design and analysis of heuristic algorithms tractable. We analyze the performance of list scheduling algorithms and equal-speed algorithms and prove that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Our extensive simulation data validate our analytical results and provide deeper insight into the performance of our heuristic algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Today's embedded systems integrate multiple IP cores for processing, communication, and sensing on a single die as systems-on-chip (SoCs). Aggressive transistor scaling, decreased voltage margins and increased processor power and temperature have made reliability assessment a much more significant issue. Although reliability of devices and interconnect has been broadly studied, in this work, we study a tradeoff between reliability and power consumption for component-based SoC designs. We specifically focus on hard error rates as they cause a device to permanently stop operating. We also present a joint reliability and power management optimization problem whose solution is an optimal management policy. When careful joint policy optimization is performed, we obtain a significant improvement in energy consumption (40%) in tandem with meeting a reliability constraint for all SoC operating temperatures},

@article{Yang2008,
	Abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by their increasing power consumption and the heat generation speed on-die. High temperature impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. While hardware level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques, such as voltage and frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold, they inevitably come at the cost of performance degradation. We propose an OS level technique that performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces the amount of hardware DTMs and achieves higher performance while keeping the temperature low. Our methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal behavior among different workloads, and schedule them to keep the chip temperature below a given budget. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the observation that there is a difference in the resulting temperature when a hot and a cool job are executed in a different order. To evaluate our scheduling algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime temperature monitor to enable informed scheduling decisions. We have implemented our scheduling algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring framework in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler can remove 10.5-73.6% of the hardware DTMs in various combinations of workloads in a medium thermal environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was improved by up to 7.6% (4.1% on average) even under a severe thermal environment.},
