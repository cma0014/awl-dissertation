b* Thermal shutdown control in the IA-32 processor
Source: [[http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/downloads/54118.htm?page%3D1][Intel.com: Thermal Protection and Monitoring Features: A Software Perspective]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The catastrophic thermal protection mechanism was an "all or nothing"
capability without pre-notification of a thermal problem. Once the
preset core temperature was reached, the processor was shutdown. With
the introduction of Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors, a new thermal
protection mechanism was introduced, allowing for the processor to
automatically control the processor temperature before reaching the
catastrophic shutdown temperature but at the expense of temporarily
reducing processor performance. Current IA-32 processors use internal
circuitry to periodically stop the internal clock to most of the
processor. All interrupts during the modulated period are delayed but
not lost. The processor time stamp counter continues to maintain count
even during processor modulation. The duration of modulation is
typically 1 msec intervals. At the end of each interval, the processor
will again operate at full frequency. If the temperature is still above
the second preset temperature level, the processor will again modulate
the internal clock. If the temperature drops below the second preset
level, the processor will continue to operate at its normal clock
frequency. The effective processor performance is approximately 50% of
full performance. Note that the method to modulate processor performance
is not architecturally specified and is subject to change in future
processors.

Automatic thermal control can be enabled / disabled by software. Bit 3
of the Model Specific Register (MSR) IA32_MISC_ENABLE_MSR (0x1A0h) is
used to enabled / disable this feature. The default for automatic
thermal control at power-on is for this bit to be cleared indicating the
feature is disabled. Unless an operating system plans to manage thermal
control directly, it will typically enable this feature if
available. Note that there is only one IA32_MISC_ENABLE_MSR per physical
processor package. If this feature is enabled on one logical processor
in a Hyper-Threading Technology (HT technology) enabled processor, this
feature is enabled for all other logical processors in the same physical
package. However, independent physical processors in a multi-processor
platform must be enabled or disabled separately. Access to this MSR
requires operating system ring 0 access, i.e. must be a device driver.
