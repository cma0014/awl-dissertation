This paper proposes a system-wide energy model for servers
using hardware performance counters and experimental measurements.
Using the HyperTransport and QuickPath Link structures as case studies
and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we
develop a chaotic time series approximation for run-time power
consumption, arriving at the Chaotic Attractor Predictor (CAP).  With
polynomial time complexity, CAP exhibits high prediction accuracy, as
verified by a set of common benchmarks.  Our CAP is a superior
predictive mechanism over existing linear auto-regressive methods, which
require corrective steps to address the non-linear, chaotic aspects of
the underlying physical system.
