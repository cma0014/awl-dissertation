	Abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, thermal hot spots and high temperature
	gradients increase the cooling costs, and degrade reliability and
	performance. In this paper, we propose a low-cost temperature management
	strategy for multicore systems to reduce the adverse effects of hot

	Abstract = {In deep submicron circuits, elevation in temperatures has brought
	new challenges in reliability, timing, performance, cooling costs
	and leakage power. Conventional thermal management techniques sacrifice
	performance to control the thermal behavior by slowing down or turning
	off the processors when a critical temperature threshold is exceeded.
	Moreover, studies have shown that in addition to high temperatures,
	temporal and spatial variations in temperature impact system reliability.
	In this work, we explore the benefits of thermally aware task scheduling
	for multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We design and evaluate
	OS-level dynamic scheduling policies with negligible performance
	overhead. We show that, using simple to implement policies that make
	decisions based on temperature measurements, better temporal and
	spatial thermal profiles can be achieved in comparison to state-of-art
	schedulers. We also enhance reactive strategies such as dynamic thread
	migration with our scheduling policies. This way, hot spots and temperature
	variations are decreased, and the performance cost is significantly
	reduced},

	of Kyoto University's supercomputer system. The supercomputer system
	of 10 TFlops had required about 540 kW on average in its first fiscal
	year 2004. After that and one-year try-and-error of power efficient
	operation, we implemented a simple but effective scheduler of jobs
	and machine powering to improve the per- load power efficiency by
	up to 39 % and to save 200 kW and {\$}200,000 electric charge in
	the fiscal year 2006. The power-aware scheduler tries to minimize
	the number of active nodes in the system of eleven nodes keeping
	sufficient computational power for given loads. Thus the power- aware
	scheduler has not degraded, but has significantly improved, the service
	quality in terms of the average job- waiting time.},

	Abstract = { With power dissipation becoming an increasingly vexing problem across
	many classes of computer systems, measuring power dissipation of
	real, running systems has become crucial for hardware and software
	system research and design. Live power measurements are imperative
	for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such
	as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex
	and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques,
	per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more
	challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe
	our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines
	real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit
	power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements
	for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns
	for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop
	workload execution. As an example application, we use the generated
	component power breakdowns to identify program power phase behaviour.
	Overall, this paper demonstrates a processor power measurement and
	estimation methodology and also gives experiences and empirical application
	results that can provide a basis for future power-aware research.},

	Abstract = { Computer systems increasingly rely on dynamic, phase-based system
	management techniques, in which system hardware and software parameters
	may be altered or tuned at runtime for different program phases.
	Prior research has considered a range of possible phase analysis
	techniques, but has focused almost exclusively on performance-oriented
	phases; the notion of power-oriented phases has not been explored.
	Moreover, the bulk of phase-analysis studies have focused on simulation
	evaluation. There is need for real-system experiments that provide
	direct comparison of different practical techniques (such as control
	flow sampling, event counters, and power measurements) for gauging
	phase behavior. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a live, real-system
	measurement framework for collecting and analyzing power phases in
	running applications. Our experimental frameworks simultaneously
	collects control flow, performance counter and live power measurement
	information. Using this framework, we directly compare between code-oriented
	techniques (such as "basic block vectors") and performance counter
	techniques for characterizing power phases. Across a collection of
	both SPEC2000 benchmarks as well as mainstream desktop applications,
	our results indicate that both techniques are promising, but that
	performance counters consistently provide better representation of
	power behavior. For many of the experimented cases, basic block vectors
	demonstrate a strong relationship between the execution path and
	power consumption. However, there are instances where power behavior
	cannot be captured from control flow, for example due to differences
	in memory hierarchy performance. We demonstrate these with examples
	from real applications. Overall, counter-based techniques offer average
	classification errors of 1.9% for SPEC and 7.1% for other benchmarks,
	while basic block vectors achieve 2.9% average errors for SPEC and
	11.7% for other benchmarks respectively.},

	the processor cache has accumulated some amount of the process state,
	i.e., data or instructions. Cache affinity is exploited by OS schedulers:
	they tend to reschedule processes to run on a recently used processor.
	On conventional (unicore) multiprocessor systems, exploitation of
	cache affinity improves performance. It is not yet known, however,
	whether similar performance improvements would be observed on multicore
	processors. Understanding these effects is crucial for design of
	efficient multicore scheduling algorithms. Our study analyzes performance
	effects of cache affinity exploitation on multicore processors. We
	find that performance improvements on multicoreuniprocessors are
	not significant. At the same time, performance improvements on multicore
	multiprocessors are rather pronounced.}}

	in higher average operating temperatures. High operating temperatures
	can lead to reduced reliability and at times thermal emergencies.
	Previous thermal-aware techniques use dynamic voltage and frequency
	scaling (DVFS) or multithreaded or multicore process migration to
	reduce thermals. However, these methods do not gracefully handle
	scenarios where processors are fully loaded, i.e. there are no free
	threads or cores for process scheduling. We propose techniques to
	reduce processor temperature when processors are fully loaded. We
	use system-level compiler support and dynamic runtime instrumentation
	to identify the relative thermal intensity of processes. We implement
	a thermal-aware process scheduling algorithm that reduces processor
	thermals while maintaining application throughput. We favor ``cool''
	processes by reducing time slice allocations for ``hot'' processes.
	Results indicate that our thermal-aware scheduling can reduce processor
	thermals by up to 3 degrees Celsius with little to no loss in application
	throughput.},

	voltage and speed is investigated as combinatorial optimization problems,
	namely, the problem of minimizing schedule length with energy consumption
	constraint and the problem of minimizing energy consumption with
	schedule length constraint. The first problem has applications in
	general multiprocessor computing systems where energy consumption
	is an important concern and in mobile computers where energy conservation
	is a main concern. The second problem has applications in real-time
	multiprocessing systems where timing constraint is a major requirement.
	These problems emphasize the tradeoff between power and performance
	and are defined such that the power-performance product is optimized
	by fixing one factor and minimizing the other. It is found that both
	problems are equivalent to the sum of powers problem and can be decomposed

	supplies. Such decomposition makes design and analysis of heuristic

	based on the energy-efficient, high-performance Intel core 2 dual-

	interconnects processor, memory, and I/O interfaces. The Blackford
	northbridge chipset provides multicore processor support and platform-level
	features and technologies. In this article, we describe the Intel
	5000 component architecture, focusing on the BNB chipset and its

	Abstract = {Today's embedded systems integrate multiple IP cores for processing,
	communication, and sensing on a single die as systems-on-chip (SoCs).
	Aggressive transistor scaling, decreased voltage margins and increased
	processor power and temperature have made reliability assessment
	a much more significant issue. Although reliability of devices and
	interconnect has been broadly studied, in this work, we study a tradeoff
	between reliability and power consumption for component-based SoC
	designs. We specifically focus on hard error rates as they cause
	a device to permanently stop operating. We also present a joint reliability
	and power management optimization problem whose solution is an optimal
	management policy. When careful joint policy optimization is performed,
	we obtain a significant improvement in energy consumption (40%) in
	tandem with meeting a reliability constraint for all SoC operating
	temperatures},

	Abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by their increasing
	power consumption and the heat generation speed on-die. High temperature
	impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. While
	hardware level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques, such
	as voltage and frequency scaling, can effectively lower the chip
	temperature when it surpasses the thermal threshold, they inevitably
	come at the cost of performance degradation. We propose an OS level
	technique that performs thermal- aware job scheduling to reduce the
	number of thermal trespasses. Our scheduler reduces the amount of
	hardware DTMs and achieves higher performance while keeping the temperature
	low. Our methods leverage the natural discrepancies in thermal behavior
	among different workloads, and schedule them to keep the chip temperature
	below a given budget. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the
	observation that there is a difference in the resulting temperature
	when a hot and a cool job are executed in a different order. To evaluate
	our scheduling algorithms, we developed a lightweight runtime temperature
	monitor to enable informed scheduling decisions. We have implemented
	our scheduling algorithm and the entire temperature monitoring framework
	in the Linux kernel. Our proposed scheduler can remove 10.5-73.6%
	of the hardware DTMs in various combinations of workloads in a medium
	thermal environment. As a result, the CPU throughput was improved
	by up to 7.6% (4.1% on average) even under a severe thermal environment.},

	Abstract = {A rising horizon in chip fabrication is the 3D integration technology.
	It stacks two or more dies vertically with a dense, high-speed interface
	to increase the device density and reduce the delay of interconnects
	significantly across the dies. However, a major challenge in 3D technology
	is the increased power density, which gives rise to the concern of
	heat dissipation within the processor. High temperatures trigger
	voltage and frequency throttlings in hardware, which degrade the
	chip performance. Moreover, high temperatures impair the processor's
	reliability and reduce its lifetime. To alleviate this problem, we
	propose in this paper an OS-level scheduling algorithm that performs
	thermal-aware task scheduling on a 3D chip. Our algorithm leverages
	the inherent thermal variations within and across different tasks,
	and schedules them to keep the chip temperature low. We observed
	that vertically adjacent dies have strong thermal correlations and
	the scheduler should consider them jointly. Compared with other intuitive
	algorithms such as a Random and a Round-Robin algorithm, our proposed
	algorithm brings lower peak temperature and average temperature on-chip.
	Moreover, it can remove, on average, 46 percent of thermal emergency
	time and result in 5.11 percent (4.78 percent) performance improvement
	over the base case on thermally homogeneous (heterogeneous) floorplans.},
