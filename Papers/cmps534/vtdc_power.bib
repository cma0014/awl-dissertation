@article{Zhang2006,
	Abstract = {One of the most challenging issues facing Grid 
communities today is that while Grids provide access to many 
heterogeneous resources, the available resources often do not 
match the needs of a specific application or service. In an 
environment where both resource availability and software 
requirements evolve rapidly, this leads to resource 
underutilization, user frustration, and much wasted effort spent 
on bridging the gap between applications and resources. These 
issues could be overcome by allowing authorized Grid clients to 
deploy clusters made up of virtual machines configured to suit 
the clienti?s software environment and hardware allocation 
requirements. In this paper, we develop descriptions and 
methods allowing us to deploy flexibly configured virtual cluster 
workspaces in the Grid. We describe their configuration, 
implementation, and evaluate them in the context of a virtual 
cluster representing the environment currently in production use 
by the Open Science Grid. Our performance evaluation results 
show that virtual clusters representing current Grid production 
environments can be efficiently deployed and managed and 
provide an acceptable platform for Grid applications.

ture, the provisioning of a customized and controllable remote execution envi- 
ronment remains an open issue. This paper introduces the concept of a virtual 
workspace, a configurable execution environment that can be created and man- 
aged as a first-class entity to reflect client requirements.  Such workspaces can 
be dynamically deployed on a variety of resources decoupling the notion of en- 
vironment and resource. We show how virtual workspaces fit into the Grid ar- 
chitecture, present an example implementation using virtual machines, and dis- 
cuss our initial experiences using this system in practice and with applications. },

	Abstract = {Grid middleware is enabling resource sharing between computing centres across the world and sites with existing clusters are eager to connect to the Grid using middleware such as that developed by the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) project. However; the hardware requirementsfor access to the Grid remain high: a standard LCG Grid gateway requiresfour separate servers. Wepropose the use of Virtual Machine (VM) technology to run multiple OS instances, allowing a full Grid gateway to be hosted on a single computer. This would significantly reduce the hardware, installation and management commitments required of a site that wants to connect to the Grid. In this paper, we outline the architecture of a single-computer Grid gateway. We evaluate implementations of this architecture using two popular open-source VMs: Xen and User-Mode Linux (UML). Our results show that Xen outperforms UML for installation tasks and standard gateway operations. Configuration is similar to that of sites running multi-computer gateways, making it easy to keep site installation profiles Synchronised. Our VM gateway architecture provides a low-cost entrypath to the Grid and will be of interest to many institutions wishing to connect their existing facilities.},

@unpublished{Hardt2005,
	Abstract = {The EDG-based Grid middleware LCG-2.4 was designed to scale from large to 
very large installations. This is unfortunate in training environments, where only 
the principles of the software and its installation are of importance, rather than 
the overall performance of the system. In such a scenario virtualisation software 
can prove to be useful, as it allows to execute several instances of an operating 
system on one physical box. 
In this paper we describe how this can be accomplished using Xen, a virtu- 
alisation environment developed at the University of Cambridge. We will start 
with a description of how to set up a training site running on one box using Xen. 
Configuration details for both Xen and LCG are explained whenever required. 
This paper is intended to be useful for training organisers as well as their 
students.

	Abstract = {Grid-Ireland, the national computational grid for Ireland, has a centrally managed core infrastructure: the installation and configuration of grid gateways at constituent sites are controlled from an Operations Centre based at Trinity College Dublin. We have developed tools to automate and simplify the deployment of Grid middleware to these sites. Virtual machine (VM) technology has performed an important role, allowing us to maximise the utilisation of server hardware and to simplify installation and management procedures. By running multiple OS instances, each on a VM, a full LCG-compatible Grid gateway can be hosted on a single computer. This has significantly reduced the hardware, installation and management investment needed to deploy a new site. In this paper, we summarise an evaluation of competing VM technologies and relate our experience with virtual machines to date. We also describe a single-computer Grid gateway based on the Xen VM system which we plan to deploy to eleven new sites in early 2005.

Recently, as transistor density and demand for computing resources have rapidly increased, even these highend systems face energy-use constraints.Commercial-server energy management now focuses on conserving power in the memory and microprocessor subsystems. Because their workloads are typically structured as multiple application programs, system-wide approaches are more applicable to multiprocessor environments in commercial servers thantechniques that primarily apply to single-application environments, such as those based on compiler optimizations.},

@article{Govil1997,
	Abstract = {Despite the fact that large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors have been commercially available for several years, system software that fully utilizes all their features is still not available, mostly due to the complexity and cost of making the required changes to the operating system. A recently proposed approach, called Disco, substantially reduces this development cost by using a virtual machine monitor that laverages the existing operating system technology. In this paper we present a system called Cellular Disco that extends the Disco work to provide all the advantages of the hardware partitioning and scalable operating system approaches. We argue that Cellular Disco can achieve these benefits at only a small fraction of the development cost of modifying the operating system. Cellular Disco effectively turns a large-scale shared-memory multiprocessor into a virtual cluster that supports fault containment and heterogeneity, while avoiding operating system scalability bottlenecks. Yet at the same time, Cellular Disco preserves the benefits of a shared-memory multiprocessor by implementing dynamic, fine-grained resource sharing, and by allowing users to overcommit resources such as processors and memory. This hybrid approach requires a scalable resource manager that makes local decisions with limited information while still providing good global performance and fault containment. In this paper we describe our experience with a Cellular Disco prototype on a 32-processor SGI Origin 2000 system. We show that the execution time penalty for this approach is low, typically within 10% of the best available commercial operating system formost workloads, and that it can manage the CPU and memory resources of the machine significantly better than the hardware partitioning approach.},

@article{Uhlig2005,
	Abstract = {A virtualized system includes a new layer of software, the virtual machine monitor. The VMM's principal role is to arbitrate accesses to the underlying physical host platform's resources so that multiple operating systems (which are guests of the VMM) can share them. The VMM presents to each guest OS a set of virtual platform interfaces that constitute a virtual machine (VM). Once confined to specialized, proprietary, high-end server and mainframe systems, virtualization is now becoming more broadly available and is supported in off-the-shelf systems based on Intel architecture (IA) hardware. This development is due in part to the steady performance improvements of IA-based systems, which mitigates traditional virtualization performance overheads. Intel virtualization technology provides hardware support for processor virtualization, enabling simplifications of virtual machine monitor software. Resulting VMMs can support a wider range of legacy and future operating systems while maintaining high performance.},

Virtuoso must be uble to mix batch und interactive VMs on the same physical hardwure, while satisfiing constraint on re- sponsiveness und compute rates for each workload. VSched is the component of Virtuoso that provides this capability. VSched is an entirely user-level tool that interacts with the stock Linux kernel running below any type-11 virtual machine monitor to schedule VMs (indeed, any process) using a periodic real-time scheduling model. This abstraction allows compute rate and responsivness constraints to be straightforwardly described using a period und a slice within the period, and it allows,for just and simple admission control. This paper makes the case,for periodic real-time scheduling for VM-based computing environments, and then describes and evaluate.s VSched. It also applies VSched to scheduling parallel worklouds, showing that it can help a BSP application maintain a fixed stable performance despite externally caused loud imbalance.},

	Abstract = {Power density continues to increase exponentially with each new technology generation, posing a major challenge for thermal management in modern processors. Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry's current trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management.

This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4-core PowerPCTMprocessor. Using benchmarks from the SPEC 2000 suite we characterize workloads in terms of instruction throughput as well as their effective duty cycles. Among a variety of options we find that distributed controltheoretic DVFS alone improves throughput by 2.5X under our test conditions. Our final design involves a PI-based core thermal controller and an outer control loop to decide process migrations. This policy avoids all thermal emergencies and yields an average of 2.6X speedup over the baseline across all workloads},

	Abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

	Abstract = {Data centers typically host clusters of hundreds and sometimes thousands of servers. Power and energy consumption have thus become key concerns in data centers. Realizing the differences between portable and server-class workloads and operating environments, researchers have developed server-specific management strategies. Despite these efforts, much must still be done. In addition to conserving power and energy in heterogeneous server clusters composed of a combination of traditional and blade servers, the authors and their colleagues also seek to enforce limits on the power each server consumes.},

	Abstract = {Virtual machines provide flexible, powerful execution environments for Grid computing, offering isolation and security mechanisms complementary to operating systems, customization and encapsulation of entire application environments, and support for legacy applications. This paper describes a Grid service -- VMPlant -- that provides for automated configuration and creation of flexible VMs that, once configured to meet application needs, can then subsequently be copied ("cloned") and dynamically instantiated to provide homogeneous execution environments across distributed Grid resources. In combination with complementary middleware for user, data and resource management, the functionality enabled by VMPlant allows for problem-solving environments to deliver Grid applications to users with unprecedented flexibility. VMPlant supports a graph-based model for the definition of customized VM configuration actions; partial graph matching, VM state storage and "cloning" for efficient creation. This paper presents the VMPlant architecture, describes a prototype implementation of the service, and presents an analysis of its performance.},
