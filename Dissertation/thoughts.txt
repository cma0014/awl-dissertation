-*- mode: Outline;-*-
* the basic premise
** reduce power consumption in data centers
*** traditional methods focus on single processor
*** data centers focus on storage
** hierarchy of machines
*** single processor machines
*** multi-core processors
*** multi-processor multi-core CPUs
*** clusters of multi-core multi-processors CPUs
*** groupings of clusters into grids
** scalable energy conservation techniques across the hierarchy
** virtualization
*** move towards virtualization
**** hardware sharing
**** Who knows about the physical hardware?
* baseline:

statistics based benchmark of power consumption of virtualization
** power consumption

for each node in the hierarchy, examine how power consumption is affected by
virtualization
** experiment design

* focus on
** the processor
*** the single multi-core processor
**** extension of "classical" methods across multiple cores
**** simularities to SMP
**** linkage to the operating system and the hypervisor
*** the cluster
**** differences between the cluster and single machine
**** coorindating policies across the cluster
***** optimizing the resource from a global standpoint
**** linkage to the operating system and the hypervisor
** the hypervisor
*** memory
**** cache management
**** relationship with the backplane network
***** in the multi-core enviornment
***** in the cluster environment
*** process scheduling
**** managing the processor by managing the workload
**** distributing the workload across the cluster
*** backplane network
* the single multi-core processor and the hypervisor
** memory
** process scheduling
* the cluster and the hypervisor
** memory
** process scheduling
* research plan
** establish the baseline
** single multi-core processor
** cluster
* deliverables
** publication plan
** prototypes
** prospectus
** dissertation
