Description:
	ARESLab is a Matlab toolbox for working with piecewise-linear and
        piecewise-cubic regression models built using the Multivariate
        Adaptive Regression Splines technique (also known as MARS).
	See reference manual for details.
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 7.1 (R14SP3).

Installation:
	Copy the ARESLab folder into the MATLAB_DIR/toolbox directory
        (where MATLAB_DIR indicates your Matlab installation directory).
        Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
        "Add folder..." button, select the folder MATLAB_DIR/toolbox/ARESLab
        in the file dialog, and press Open. Subsequently, press the Save
        button in order to save your changes to the Matlab search path.
        The toolbox is now installed.
