Purpose: Define the sensor reading format

We avoid having to put the code for reading sensor data into the kernel
by providing a userland process that reads the data from the various
devices and writes a string containing the readings into a file stored
in /tmp.  Long term the plan is to replace this obvious hack with
writing this string to a piece of shared memory.

We also include a version of this server that reads data from the data
collection spreadsheets we used to build the model.  This code writes to
the same location.

The data file in /tmp contains one record in the format
<TS> T  <TC1> <TC2> <TA1> <TA2> F <BF1> <BF2> <AF1> <AF2> H <HT0> <HT1> <HT2> C <CM0> <CM1> <CM2> <CM3>

where we have the following:
<TS>  timestamp
T
<TC1>	Die temp of CPU1
<TC2>	Die temp of CPU2
<TA1>	Ambient temp 1
<TA2>   Ambient temp 2
F
<BF1>   Blower Fan Speed at CPU1
<BF2>	Blower Fan Speed at CPU2
<AF1>	Axial Fan Speed at Memory Bank 1
<AF2>	Axial Fan Speed at Memory Bank 2
H
<HT0>	Number of HT bus transactions on bus 0
<HT1>	Number of HT bus transactions on bus 1
<HT2>	Number of HT bus transactions on bus 2
C
<CM0>	L2 cache misses for core 0
<CM1>	L2 cache misses for core 1
<CM2>	L2 cache misses for core 2
<CM3>	L2 cache misses for core 3
